</div>

<p class='c009'>The first edition (here reprinted) was published in 1819 in one 8vo. volume
(343 pp.), with the following title-page:—‘Lectures on the English Comic
Writers. Delivered at the Surry Institution. By William Hazlitt. “It is a
very good office one man does another, when he tells him the manner of his
being pleased.” Steele. London: Printed for Taylor and Hessey, 93. Fleet
Street. 1819.’ The volume was printed by J. Miller, Noble Street, Cheapside.
The ‘third edition’ (the second having been presumably a mere re-print of the
first), edited by the author’s son and published by Templeman, appeared in 1841,
and included some additions collected from various sources. These additions are
referred to in the notes to the present volume. The first edition was republished
by Mr. W. C. Hazlitt in Bohn’s Library in 1869, and the third edition has quite
recently been included in the Temple Classics series ‘under the immediate
editorial care of Mr. Austin Dobson’ (1900).</p>

<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE I INTRODUCTORY<br /> <span class='c013'>ON WIT AND HUMOUR</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps; for he is the only
animal that is struck with the difference between what things are, and
what they ought to be. We weep at what thwarts or exceeds our desires
in serious matters: we laugh at what only disappoints our expectations
in trifles. We shed tears from sympathy with real and necessary
distress; as we burst into laughter from want of sympathy with that
which is unreasonable and unnecessary, the absurdity of which
provokes our spleen or mirth, rather than any serious reflections on it.</p>

<p class='c014'>To explain the nature of laughter and tears, is to account for the
condition of human life; for it is in a manner compounded of these
two! It is a tragedy or a comedy—sad or merry, as it happens.
The crimes and misfortunes that are inseparable from it, shock and
wound the mind when they once seize upon it, and when the pressure
can no longer be borne, seek relief in tears: the follies and absurdities
that men commit, or the odd accidents that befal them, afford us
amusement from the very rejection of these false claims upon our
sympathy, and end in laughter. If every thing that went wrong, if
every vanity or weakness in another gave us a sensible pang, it would
be hard indeed: but as long as the disagreeableness of the consequences
of a sudden disaster is kept out of sight by the immediate
oddity of the circumstances, and the absurdity or unaccountableness of
a foolish action is the most striking thing in it, the ludicrous prevails
over the pathetic, and we receive pleasure instead of pain from the
farce of life which is played before us, and which discomposes our
gravity as often as it fails to move our anger or our pity!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Tears may be considered as the natural and involuntary resource of
the mind overcome by some sudden and violent emotion, before it has
had time to reconcile its feelings to the change of circumstances:
while laughter may be defined to be the same sort of convulsive and
involuntary movement, occasioned by mere surprise or contrast (in the
absence of any more serious emotion), before it has time to reconcile
its belief to contradictory appearances. If we hold a mask before our
face, and approach a child with this disguise on, it will at first, from
the oddity and incongruity of the appearance, be inclined to laugh;
if we go nearer to it, steadily, and without saying a word, it will
begin to be alarmed, and be half inclined to cry: if we suddenly take off
the mask, it will recover from its fears, and burst out a-laughing; but
if, instead of presenting the old well-known countenance, we have
concealed a satyr’s head or some frightful caricature behind the first
mask, the suddenness of the change will not in this case be a source
of merriment to it, but will convert its surprise into an agony of consternation,
and will make it scream out for help, even though it may
be convinced that the whole is a trick at bottom.</p>

<p class='c014'>The alternation of tears and laughter, in this little episode in
common life, depends almost entirely on the greater or less degree of
interest attached to the different changes of appearance. The mere
suddenness of the transition, the mere baulking our expectations, and
turning them abruptly into another channel, seems to give additional
liveliness and gaiety to the animal spirits; but the instant the change
is not only sudden, but threatens serious consequences, or calls up the
shape of danger, terror supersedes our disposition to mirth, and
laughter gives place to tears. It is usual to play with infants, and
make them laugh by clapping your hands suddenly before them; but
if you clap your hands too loud, or too near their sight, their countenances
immediately change, and they hide them in the nurse’s arms.
Or suppose the same child, grown up a little older, comes to a place,
expecting to meet a person it is particularly fond of, and does not find
that person there, its countenance suddenly falls, its lips begin to
quiver, its cheek turns pale, its eye glistens, and it vents its little
sorrow (grown too big to be concealed) in a flood of tears. Again,
if the child meets the same person unexpectedly after long absence,
the same effect will be produced by an excess of joy, with different
accompaniments; that is, the surprise and the emotion excited will
make the blood come into his face, his eyes sparkle, his tongue falter
or be mute, but in either case the tears will gush to his relief, and
lighten the pressure about his heart. On the other hand, if a child
is playing at hide-and-seek, or blindman’s-buff, with persons it is ever
so fond of, and either misses them where it had made sure of finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>them, or suddenly runs up against them where it had least expected
it, the shock or additional impetus given to the imagination by the
disappointment or the discovery, in a matter of this indifference, will
only vent itself in a fit of laughter.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The transition here is not from
one thing of importance to another, or from a state of indifference to
a state of strong excitement; but merely from one impression to
another that we did not at all expect, and when we had expected just
the contrary. The mind having been led to form a certain conclusion,
and the result producing an immediate solution of continuity in the
chain of our ideas, this alternate excitement and relaxation of the
imagination, the object also striking upon the mind more vividly in its
loose unsettled state, and before it has had time to recover and collect
itself, causes that alternate excitement and relaxation, or irregular
convulsive movement of the muscular and nervous system, which
constitutes physical laughter. The <i>discontinuous</i> in our sensations
produces a correspondent jar and discord in the frame. The
steadiness of our faith and of our features begins to give way at the
same time. We turn with an incredulous smile from a story that
staggers our belief: and we are ready to split our sides with laughing
at an extravagance that sets all common sense and serious concern at
defiance.</p>

<p class='c014'>To understand or define the ludicrous, we must first know what
the serious is. Now the serious is the habitual stress which the mind
lays upon the expectation of a given order of events, following one
another with a certain regularity and weight of interest attached to
them. When this stress is increased beyond its usual pitch of
intensity, so as to overstrain the feelings by the violent opposition of
good to bad, or of objects to our desires, it becomes the pathetic or
tragical. The ludicrous, or comic, is the unexpected loosening or
relaxing this stress below its usual pitch of intensity, by such an
abrupt transposition of the order of our ideas, as taking the mind
unawares, throws it off its guard, startles it into a lively sense of
pleasure, and leaves no time nor inclination for painful reflections.</p>

<p class='c014'>The essence of the laughable then is the incongruous, the disconnecting
one idea from another, or the jostling of one feeling against
another. The first and most obvious cause of laughter is to be found
in the simple succession of events, as in the sudden shifting of a
disguise, or some unlooked-for accident, without any absurdity of
character or situation. The accidental contradiction between our
expectations and the event can hardly be said, however, to amount to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the ludicrous: it is merely laughable. The ludicrous is where there
is the same contradiction between the object and our expectations,
heightened by some deformity or inconvenience, that is, by its being
contrary to what is customary or desirable; as the ridiculous, which
is the highest degree of the laughable, is that which is contrary not
only to custom but to sense and reason, or is a voluntary departure
from what we have a right to expect from those who are conscious of
absurdity and propriety in words, looks, and actions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of these different kinds or degrees of the laughable, the first is the
most shallow and short-lived; for the instant the immediate surprise
of a thing’s merely happening one way or another is over, there is
nothing to throw us back upon our former expectation, and renew our
wonder at the event a second time. The second sort, that is, the
ludicrous arising out of the improbable or distressing, is more deep
and lasting, either because the painful catastrophe excites a greater
curiosity, or because the old impression, from its habitual hold on the
imagination, still recurs mechanically, so that it is longer before we
can seriously make up our minds to the unaccountable deviation from
it. The third sort, or the ridiculous arising out of absurdity as well
as improbability, that is, where the defect or weakness is of a man’s own
seeking, is the most refined of all, but not always so pleasant as the
last, because the same contempt and disapprobation which sharpens
and subtilises our sense of the impropriety, adds a severity to it
inconsistent with perfect ease and enjoyment. This last species is
properly the province of satire. The principle of contrast is, however,
the same in all the stages, in the simply laughable, the ludicrous,
the ridiculous; and the effect is only the more complete, the more
durably and pointedly this principle operates.</p>

<p class='c014'>To give some examples in these different kinds. We laugh, when
children, at the sudden removing of a pasteboard mask: we laugh,
when grown up, more gravely at the tearing off the mask of deceit.
We laugh at absurdity; we laugh at deformity. We laugh at
a bottle-nose in a caricature; at a stuffed figure of an alderman in a
pantomime, and at the tale of Slaukenbergius. A giant standing by
a dwarf makes a contemptible figure enough. Rosinante and Dapple
are laughable from contrast, as their masters from the same principle
make two for a pair. We laugh at the dress of foreigners, and they
at ours. Three chimney-sweepers meeting three Chinese in Lincoln’s-inn
Fields, they laughed at one another till they were ready to drop
down. Country people laugh at a person because they never saw him
before. Any one dressed in the height of the fashion, or quite out of
it, is equally an object of ridicule. One rich source of the ludicrous
is distress with which we cannot sympathise from its absurdity or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>insignificance. Women laugh at their lovers. We laugh at a damned
author, in spite of our teeth, and though he may be our friend.
‘There is something in the misfortunes of our best friends that pleases
us.’ We laugh at people on the top of a stage-coach, or in it, if they
seem in great extremity. It is hard to hinder children from laughing
at a stammerer, at a negro, at a drunken man, or even at a madman.
We laugh at mischief. We laugh at what we do not believe. We
say that an argument or an assertion that is very absurd, is quite
ludicrous. We laugh to shew our satisfaction with ourselves, or our
contempt for those about us, or to conceal our envy or our ignorance.
We laugh at fools, and at those who pretend to be wise—at extreme
simplicity, awkwardness, hypocrisy, and affectation. ‘They were
talking of me,’ says Scrub, ‘for they laughed <i>consumedly</i>.’ Lord
Foppington’s insensibility to ridicule, and airs of ineffable self-conceit,
are no less admirable; and Joseph Surface’s cant maxims
of morality, when once disarmed of their power to do hurt,
become sufficiently ludicrous.—We laugh at that in others which is
a serious matter to ourselves; because our self-love is stronger than
our sympathy, sooner takes the alarm, and instantly turns our heedless
mirth into gravity, which only enhances the jest to others. Some
one is generally sure to be the sufferer by a joke. What is sport to
one, is death to another. It is only very sensible or very honest
people, who laugh as freely at their own absurdities as at those of
their neighbours. In general the contrary rule holds, and we only
laugh at those misfortunes in which we are spectators, not sharers.
The injury, the disappointment, shame, and vexation that we feel, put
a stop to our mirth; while the disasters that come home to us, and
excite our repugnance and dismay, are an amusing spectacle to others.
The greater resistance we make, and the greater the perplexity into
which we are thrown, the more lively and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquant</span></i> is the intellectual
display of cross-purposes to the by-standers. Our humiliation is their
triumph. We are occupied with the disagreeableness of the result
instead of its oddity or unexpectedness. Others see only the conflict
of motives, and the sudden alternation of events; we feel the pain
as well, which more than counterbalances the speculative entertainment
we might receive from the contemplation of our abstract situation.</p>

<p class='c014'>You cannot force people to laugh: you cannot give a reason why
they should laugh: they must laugh of themselves, or not at all. As
we laugh from a spontaneous impulse, we laugh the more at any
restraint upon this impulse. We laugh at a thing merely because we
ought not. If we think we must not laugh, this perverse impediment
makes our temptation to laugh the greater; for by endeavouring to
keep the obnoxious image out of sight, it comes upon us more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>irresistibly and repeatedly; and the inclination to indulge our mirth,
the longer it is held back, collects its force, and breaks out the more
violently in peals of laughter. In like manner, any thing we must not
think of makes us laugh, by its coming upon us by stealth and
unawares, and from the very efforts we make to exclude it. A secret,
a loose word, a wanton jest, make people laugh. Aretine laughed
himself to death at hearing a lascivious story. Wickedness is often
made a substitute for wit; and in most of our good old comedies, the
intrigue of the plot and the double meaning of the dialogue go hand-in-hand,
and keep up the ball with wonderful spirit between them.
The consciousness, however it may arise, that there is something that
we ought to look grave at, is almost always a signal for laughing
outright: we can hardly keep our countenance at a sermon, a funeral,
or a wedding. What an excellent old custom was that of throwing
the stocking! What a deal of innocent mirth has been spoiled by
the disuse of it!—It is not an easy matter to preserve decorum in
courts of justice. The smallest circumstance that interferes with the
solemnity of the proceedings, throws the whole place into an uproar
of laughter. People at the point of death often say smart things.
Sir Thomas More jested with his executioner. Rabelais and
Wycherley both died with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mot</span></i> in their mouths.</p>

<p class='c014'>Misunderstandings, (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malentendus</span></i>) where one person means one
thing, and another is aiming at something else, are another great
source of comic humour, on the same principle of ambiguity and
contrast. There is a high-wrought instance of this in the dialogue
between Aimwell and Gibbet, in the Beaux’ Stratagem, where
Aimwell mistakes his companion for an officer in a marching regiment,
and Gibbet takes it for granted that the gentleman is a highwayman.
The alarm and consternation occasioned by some one saying to him,
in the course of common conversation, ‘I apprehend you,’ is the most
ludicrous thing in that admirably natural and powerful performance,
Mr. Emery’s Robert Tyke. Again, unconsciousness in the person
himself of what he is about, or of what others think of him, is also
a great heightener of the sense of absurdity. It makes it come the
fuller home upon us from his insensibility to it. His simplicity sets
off the satire, and gives it a finer edge. It is a more extreme case
still where the person is aware of being the object of ridicule, and yet
seems perfectly reconciled to it as a matter of course. So wit is often
the more forcible and pointed for being dry and serious, for it then
seems as if the speaker himself had no intention in it, and we were
the first to find it out. Irony, as a species of wit, owes its force to
the same principle. In such cases it is the contrast between the
appearance and the reality, the suspense of belief, and the seeming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>incongruity, that gives point to the ridicule, and makes it enter the
deeper when the first impression is overcome. Excessive impudence,
as in the Liar; or excessive modesty, as in the hero of She Stoops to
Conquer; or a mixture of the two, as in the Busy Body, are equally
amusing. Lying is a species of wit and humour. To lay any thing
to a person’s charge from which he is perfectly free, shews spirit and
invention; and the more incredible the effrontery, the greater is the
joke.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is nothing more powerfully humorous than what is called
<i>keeping</i> in comic character, as we see it very finely exemplified in
Sancho Panza and Don Quixote. The proverbial phlegm and the
romantic gravity of these two celebrated persons may be regarded as
the height of this kind of excellence. The deep feeling of character
strengthens the sense of the ludicrous. Keeping in comic character is
consistency in absurdity; a determined and laudable attachment to
the incongruous and singular. The regularity completes the contradiction;
for the number of instances of deviation from the right line,
branching out in all directions, shews the inveteracy of the original
bias to any extravagance or folly, the natural improbability, as it
were, increasing every time with the multiplication of chances for a
return to common sense, and in the end mounting up to an incredible
and unaccountably ridiculous height, when we find our expectations
as invariably baffled. The most curious problem of all, is this truth
of absurdity to itself. That reason and good sense should be consistent,
is not wonderful: but that caprice, and whim, and fantastical
prejudice, should be uniform and infallible in their results, is the
surprising thing. But while this characteristic clue to absurdity helps
on the ridicule, it also softens and harmonises its excesses; and the
ludicrous is here blended with a certain beauty and decorum, from
this very truth of habit and sentiment, or from the principle of
similitude in dissimilitude. The devotion to nonsense, and enthusiasm
about trifles, is highly affecting as a moral lesson: it is one of the
striking weaknesses and greatest happinesses of our nature. That
which excites so lively and lasting an interest in itself, even though it
should not be wisdom, is not despicable in the sight of reason and
humanity. We cannot suppress the smile on the lip; but the tear
should also stand ready to start from the eye. The history of hobbyhorses
is equally instructive and delightful; and after the pair I have
just alluded to, My Uncle Toby’s is one of the best and gentlest that
‘ever lifted leg!’ The inconveniences, odd accidents, falls, and
bruises, to which they expose their riders, contribute their share to
the amusement of the spectators; and the blows and wounds that the
Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance received in his many perilous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>adventures, have applied their healing influence to many a hurt mind.—In
what relates to the laughable, as it arises from unforeseen
accidents or self-willed scrapes, the pain, the shame, the mortification,
and utter helplessness of situation, add to the joke, provided they are
momentary, or overwhelming only to the imagination of the sufferer.
Malvolio’s punishment and apprehensions are as comic, from our
knowing that they are not real, as Christopher Sly’s drunken transformation
and short-lived dream of happiness are for the like reason.
Parson Adams’s fall into the tub at the ‘Squire’s, or his being
discovered in bed with Mrs. Slipslop, though pitiable, are laughable
accidents: nor do we read with much gravity of the loss of his
Æschylus, serious as it was to him at the time.—A Scotch clergyman,
as he was going to church, seeing a spruce conceited mechanic
who was walking before him, suddenly covered all over with dirt,
either by falling into the kennel, or by some other calamity befalling
him, smiled and passed on: but afterwards seeing the same person,
who had stopped to refit, seated directly facing him in the gallery,
with a look of perfect satisfaction and composure, as if nothing of the
sort had happened to him, the idea of his late disaster and present
self-complacency struck him so powerfully, that, unable to resist the
impulse, he flung himself back in the pulpit, and laughed till he could
laugh no longer. I remember reading a story in an odd number of
the European Magazine, of an old gentleman who used to walk out
every afternoon, with a gold-headed cane, in the fields opposite
Baltimore House, which were then open, only with foot-paths crossing
them. He was frequently accosted by a beggar with a wooden leg,
to whom he gave money, which only made him more importunate.
One day, when he was more troublesome than usual, a well-dressed
person happening to come up, and observing how saucy the fellow
was, said to the gentleman, ‘Sir, if you will lend me your cane for
a moment, I’ll give him a good threshing for his impertinence.’
The old gentleman, smiling at the proposal, handed him his cane,
which the other no sooner was going to apply to the shoulders of the
culprit, than he immediately whipped off his wooden leg, and
scampered off with great alacrity, and his chastiser after him as hard
as he could go. The faster the one ran, the faster the other followed
him, brandishing the cane, to the great astonishment of the gentleman
who owned it, till having fairly crossed the fields, they suddenly
turned a corner, and nothing more was seen of either of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the way of mischievous adventure, and a wanton exhibition of
ludicrous weakness in character, nothing is superior to the comic
parts of the Arabian Nights’ Entertainments. To take only the set
of stories of the Little Hunchback, who was choked with a bone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and the Barber of Bagdad and his seven brothers,—there is that of
the tailor who was persecuted by the miller’s wife, and who, after
toiling all night in the mill, got nothing for his pains:—of another
who fell in love with a fine lady who pretended to return his passion,
and inviting him to her house, as the preliminary condition of her
favour, had his eyebrows shaved, his clothes stripped off, and being
turned loose into a winding gallery, he was to follow her, and by
overtaking obtain all his wishes, but, after a turn or two, stumbled on
a trap-door, and fell plump into the street, to the great astonishment
of the spectators and his own, shorn of his eyebrows, naked, and
without a ray of hope left:—that of the castle-building pedlar, who,
in kicking his wife, the supposed daughter of an emperor, kicks down
his basket of glass, the brittle foundation of his ideal wealth, his good
fortune, and his arrogance:—that, again, of the beggar who dined
with the Barmecide, and feasted with him on the names of wines
and dishes: and, last and best of all, the inimitable story of the
Impertinent Barber himself, one of the seven, and worthy to be so;
his pertinacious, incredible, teasing, deliberate, yet unmeaning folly,
his wearing out the patience of the young gentleman whom he is sent
for to shave, his preparations and his professions of speed, his taking
out an astrolabe to measure the height of the sun while his razors are
getting ready, his dancing the dance of Zimri and singing the song of
Zamtout, his disappointing the young man of an assignation, following
him to the place of rendezvous, and alarming the master of the house
in his anxiety for his safety, by which his unfortunate patron loses his
hand in the affray, and this is felt as an awkward accident. The
danger which the same loquacious person is afterwards in, of losing
his head for want of saying who he was, because he would not forfeit
his character of being ‘justly called the Silent,’ is a consummation of
the jest, though, if it had really taken place, it would have been
carrying the joke too far. There are a thousand instances of the
same sort in the Thousand and One Nights, which are an inexhaustible
mine of comic humour and invention, and which, from the
manners of the East which they describe, carry the principle of
callous indifference in a jest as far as it can go. The serious and
marvellous stories in that work, which have been so much admired
and so greedily read, appear to me monstrous and abortive fictions,
like disjointed dreams, dictated by a preternatural dread of arbitrary
and despotic power, as the comic and familiar stories are rendered
proportionably amusing and interesting from the same principle operating
in a different direction, and producing endless uncertainty and
vicissitude, and an heroic contempt for the untoward accidents and
petty vexations of human life. It is the gaiety of despair, the mirth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and laughter of a respite during pleasure from death. The strongest
instances of effectual and harrowing imagination, are in the story of
Amine and her three sisters, whom she led by her side as a leash of
hounds, and of the <i>goul</i> who nibbled grains of rice for her dinner, and
preyed on human carcasses. In this condemnation of the serious parts
of the Arabian Nights, I have nearly all the world, and in particular
the author of the Ancient Mariner, against me, who must be allowed
to be a judge of such matters, and who said, with a subtlety of
philosophical conjecture which he alone possesses, ‘That if I did not
like them, it was because I did not dream.’ On the other hand, I
have Bishop Atterbury on my side, who, in a letter to Pope, fairly
confesses that ‘he could not read them in his old age.’</p>

<p class='c014'>There is another source of comic humour which has been but little
touched on or attended to by the critics—not the infliction of casual
pain, but the pursuit of uncertain pleasure and idle gallantry. Half
the business and gaiety of comedy turns upon this. Most of the
adventures, difficulties, demurs, hair-breadth ‘scapes, disguises, deceptions,
blunders, disappointments, successes, excuses, all the dextrous
manœuvres, artful inuendos, assignations, billets-doux, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendres</span></i>,
sly allusions, and elegant flattery, have an eye to this—to the
obtaining of those ‘favours secret, sweet, and precious,’ in which love
and pleasure consist, and which when attained, and the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">equivoque</span></i> is at
an end, the curtain drops, and the play is over. All the attractions
of a subject that can only be glanced at indirectly, that is a sort of
forbidden ground to the imagination, except under severe restrictions,
which are constantly broken through; all the resources it supplies for
intrigue and invention; the bashfulness of the clownish lover, his
looks of alarm and petrified astonishment; the foppish affectation and
easy confidence of the happy man; the dress, the airs, the languor,
the scorn, and indifference of the fine lady; the bustle, pertness,
loquaciousness, and tricks of the chambermaid; the impudence, lies,
and roguery of the valet; the match-making and unmaking; the
wisdom of the wise; the sayings of the witty, the folly of the fool;
‘the soldier’s, scholar’s, courtier’s eye, tongue, sword, the glass of
fashion and the mould of form,’ have all a view to this. It is the
closet in Blue-Beard. It is the life and soul of Wycherley, Congreve,
Vanbrugh, and Farquhar’s plays. It is the salt of comedy, without
which it would be worthless and insipid. It makes Horner decent,
and Millamant divine. It is the jest between Tattle and Miss Prue.
It is the bait with which Olivia, in the Plain Dealer, plays with
honest Manly. It lurks at the bottom of the catechism which Archer
teaches Cherry, and which she learns by heart. It gives the finishing
grace to Mrs. Amlet’s confession—‘Though I’m old, I’m chaste.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Valentine and his Angelica would be nothing without it; Miss Peggy
would not be worth a gallant; and Slender’s ‘sweet Ann Page’
would be no more! ‘The age of comedy would be gone, and the
glory of our play-houses extinguished for ever.’ Our old comedies
would be invaluable, were it only for this, that they keep alive this
sentiment, which still survives in all its fluttering grace and breathless
palpitations on the stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Humour is the describing the ludicrous as it is in itself; wit is the
exposing it, by comparing or contrasting it with something else.
Humour is, as it were, the growth of nature and accident; wit is the
product of art and fancy. Humour, as it is shewn in books, is an
imitation of the natural or acquired absurdities of mankind, or of the
ludicrous in accident, situation, and character: wit is the illustrating
and heightening the sense of that absurdity by some sudden and
unexpected likeness or opposition of one thing to another, which sets
off the quality we laugh at or despise in a still more contemptible or
striking point of view. Wit, as distinguished from poetry, is the
imagination or fancy inverted, and so applied to given objects, as to
make the little look less, the mean more light and worthless; or to
divert our admiration or wean our affections from that which is lofty
and impressive, instead of producing a more intense admiration and
exalted passion, as poetry does. Wit may sometimes, indeed, be
shewn in compliments as well as satire; as in the common epigram—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Accept a miracle, instead of wit:</div>
      <div class='line'>See two dull lines with Stanhope’s pencil writ.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But then the mode of paying it is playful and ironical, and contradicts
itself in the very act of making its own performance an humble foil
to another’s. Wit hovers round the borders of the light and trifling,
whether in matters of pleasure or pain; for as soon as it describes the
serious seriously, it ceases to be wit, and passes into a different form.
Wit is, in fact, the eloquence of indifference, or an ingenious and
striking exposition of those evanescent and glancing impressions of
objects which affect us more from surprise or contrast to the train of
our ordinary and literal preconceptions, than from anything in the
objects themselves exciting our necessary sympathy or lasting hatred.
The favourite employment of wit is to add littleness to littleness, and
heap contempt on insignificance by all the arts of petty and incessant
warfare; or if it ever affects to aggrandise, and use the language of
hyperbole, it is only to betray into derision by a fatal comparison, as
in the mock-heroic; or if it treats of serious passion, it must do it so
as to lower the tone of intense and high-wrought sentiment, by the
introduction of burlesque and familiar circumstances. To give an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>instance or two. Butler, in his Hudibras, compares the change of
night into day, to the change of colour in a boiled lobster.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The sun had long since, in the lap</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Thetis, taken out his nap;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, like a lobster boil’d, the morn</div>
      <div class='line'>From black to red, began to turn:</div>
      <div class='line'>When Hudibras, whom thoughts and aching</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twixt sleeping kept all night, and waking,</div>
      <div class='line'>Began to rub his drowsy eyes,</div>

<p class='c017'>In this last passage, every image is brought forward that can give
effect to our natural impression of the beauty, the splendour, and
solemn grandeur of the rising sun; pleasure and power wait on every
line and word: whereas, in the other, the only memorable thing is a
grotesque and ludicrous illustration of the alteration which takes place
from darkness to gorgeous light, and that brought from the lowest
instance, and with associations that can only disturb and perplex the
imagination in its conception of the real object it describes. There
cannot be a more witty, and at the same time degrading comparison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>than that in the same author, of the Bear turning round the pole-star
to a bear tied to a stake:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But now a sport more formidable</div>

      <div class='line'>’Twas an old way of recreating</div>
      <div class='line'>Which learned butchers call bear-baiting,</div>
      <div class='line'>A bold adventurous exercise</div>
      <div class='line'>With ancient heroes in high prize,</div>
      <div class='line'>For authors do affirm it came</div>

      <div class='line'>That’s fixed in Northern hemisphere,</div>
      <div class='line'>And round about his pole does make</div>
      <div class='line'>A circle like a bear at stake,</div>
      <div class='line'>That at the chain’s end wheels about</div>
      <div class='line'>And overturns the rabble rout.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>I need not multiply examples of this sort.—Wit or ludicrous invention
produces its effect oftenest by comparison, but not always. It
frequently effects its purposes by unexpected and subtle distinctions.
For instance, in the first kind, Mr. Sheridan’s description of Mr.
Addington’s administration as the fag-end of Mr. Pitt’s, who had
remained so long on the treasury bench that, like Nicias in the fable,
‘he left the sitting part of the man behind him,’ is as fine an example
of metaphorical wit as any on record. The same idea seems,
however, to have been included in the old well-known nickname of the
<i>Rump</i> Parliament. Almost as happy an instance of the other kind of
wit, which consists in sudden retorts, in turns upon an idea, and
diverting the train of your adversary’s argument abruptly and adroitly
into another channel, may be seen in the sarcastic reply of Porson,
who hearing some one observe that ‘certain modern poets would be
read and admired when Homer and Virgil were forgotten,’ made
answer—‘And not till then!’ Sir Robert Walpole’s definition of
the gratitude of place-expectants, ‘That it is a lively sense of <i>future</i>
favours,’ is no doubt wit, but it does not consist in the finding out any
coincidence or likeness, but in suddenly transposing the order of time
in the common account of this feeling, so as to make the professions
of those who pretend to it correspond more with their practice. It
is filling up a blank in the human heart with a word that explains its
hollowness at once. Voltaire’s saying, in answer to a stranger who
was observing how tall his trees grew—‘That they had nothing else
to do’—was a quaint mixture of wit and humour, making it out as if
they really led a lazy, laborious life; but there was here neither
allusion or metaphor. Again, that master-stroke in Hudibras is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>sterling wit and profound satire, where speaking of certain religious
hypocrites he says, that they</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Compound for sins they are inclin’d to,</div>
      <div class='line'>By damning those they have no mind to;’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>but the wit consists in the truth of the character, and in the happy
exposure of the ludicrous contradiction between the pretext and the
practice; between their lenity towards their own vices, and their
severity to those of others. The same principle of nice distinction
must be allowed to prevail in those lines of the same author, where
he is professing to expound the dreams of judicial astrology.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There’s but the twinkling of a star</div>
      <div class='line'>Betwixt a man of peace and war,</div>
      <div class='line'>A thief and justice, fool and knave,</div>
      <div class='line'>A huffing officer and a slave;</div>
      <div class='line'>A crafty lawyer and pickpocket;</div>
      <div class='line'>A great philosopher and a blockhead;</div>
      <div class='line'>A formal preacher and a player;</div>
      <div class='line'>A learn’d physician and man slayer.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The finest piece of wit I know of, is in the lines of Pope on the Lord
Mayor’s show—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Now night descending, the proud scene is o’er,</div>
      <div class='line'>But lives in Settle’s numbers one day more.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This is certainly as mortifying an inversion of the idea of poetical
immortality as could be thought of; it fixes the <i>maximum</i> of littleness
and insignificance: but it is not by likeness to any thing else that it
does this, but by literally taking the lowest possible duration of
ephemeral reputation, marking it (as with a slider) on the scale of
endless renown, and giving a rival credit for it as his loftiest praise.
In a word, the shrewd separation or disentangling of ideas that seem
the same, or where the secret contradiction is not sufficiently
suspected, and is of a ludicrous and whimsical nature, is wit just as
much as the bringing together those that appear at first sight totally
different. There is then no sufficient ground for admitting Mr.
Locke’s celebrated definition of wit, which he makes to consist in
the finding out striking and unexpected resemblances in things so as to
make pleasant pictures in the fancy, while judgment and reason,
according to him, lie the clean contrary way, in separating and
nicely distinguishing those wherein the smallest difference is to be
found.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>On this definition Harris, the author of Hermes, has very well
observed that the demonstrating the equality of the three angles of a
right-angled triangle to two right ones, would, upon the principle
here stated, be a piece of wit instead of an act of the judgment, or
understanding, and Euclid’s Elements a collection of epigrams. On
the contrary it has appeared, that the detection and exposure of
difference, particularly where this implies nice and subtle observation,
as in discriminating between pretence and practice, between appearance
and reality, is common to wit and satire with judgment and reasoning,
and certainly the comparing and connecting our ideas together is an
essential part of reason and judgment, as well as of wit and fancy.—Mere
wit, as opposed to reason or argument, consists in striking out
some casual and partial coincidence which has nothing to do, or at
least implies no necessary connection with the nature of the things,
which are forced into a seeming analogy by a play upon words, or
some irrelevant conceit, as in puns, riddles, alliteration, &amp;c. The
jest, in all such cases, lies in the sort of mock-identity, or nominal
resemblance, established by the intervention of the same words
expressing different ideas, and countenancing as it were, by a fatality
of language, the mischievous insinuation which the person who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the wit to take advantage of it wishes to convey. So when the
disaffected French wits applied to the new order of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fleur du lys</span></i>
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i> of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compagnons d’Ulysse</span></i>, or companions of Ulysses,
meaning the animal into which the fellow-travellers of the hero of the
Odyssey were transformed, this was a shrewd and biting intimation of
a galling truth (if truth it were) by a fortuitous concourse of letters
of the alphabet, jumping in ‘a foregone conclusion,’ but there was no
proof of the thing, unless it was self-evident. And, indeed, this may
be considered as the best defence of the contested maxim—<i>That
ridicule is the test of truth</i>; viz. that it does not contain or attempt a
formal proof of it, but owes its power of conviction to the bare
suggestion of it, so that if the thing when once hinted is not clear in
itself, the satire fails of its effect and falls to the ground. The
sarcasm here glanced at the character of the new or old French
noblesse may not be well founded; but it is so like truth, and ‘comes
in such a questionable shape,’ backed with the appearance of an
identical proposition, that it would require a long train of facts and
laboured arguments to do away the impression, even if we were sure of
the honesty and wisdom of the person who undertook to refute it. A
flippant jest is as good a test of truth as a solid bribe; and there are
serious sophistries,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Soul-killing lies, and truths that work small good,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>as well as idle pleasantries. Of this we may be sure, that ridicule
fastens on the vulnerable points of a cause, and finds out the weak
sides of an argument; if those who resort to it sometimes rely too
much on its success, those who are chiefly annoyed by it almost
always are so with reason, and cannot be too much on their guard
against deserving it. Before we can laugh at a thing, its absurdity
must at least be open and palpable to common apprehension. Ridicule
is necessarily built on certain supposed facts, whether true or false,
and on their inconsistency with certain acknowledged maxims,
whether right or wrong. It is, therefore, a fair test, if not of philosophical
or abstract truth, at least of what is truth according to public
opinion and common sense; for it can only expose to instantaneous
contempt that which is condemned by public opinion, and is hostile to
the common sense of mankind. Or to put it differently, it is the test
of the quantity of truth that there is in our favourite prejudices.—To
shew how nearly allied wit is thought to be to truth, it is not unusual
to say of any person—‘Such a one is a man of sense, for though he
said nothing, he laughed in the right place.’—Alliteration comes in
here under the head of a certain sort of verbal wit; or, by pointing
the expression, sometimes points the sense. Mr. Grattan’s wit or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>eloquence (I don’t know by what name to call it) would be nothing
without this accompaniment. Speaking of some ministers whom he
did not like, he said, ‘Their only means of government are the guinea
and the gallows.’ There can scarcely, it must be confessed, be a
more effectual mode of political conversion than one of these applied
to a man’s friends, and the other to himself. The fine sarcasm of
Junius on the effect of the supposed ingratitude of the Duke of
Grafton at court—‘The instance might be painful, but the principle
would please’—notwithstanding the profound insight into human
nature it implies, would hardly pass for wit without the alliteration,
as some poetry would hardly be acknowledged as such without the
rhyme to clench it. A quotation or a hackneyed phrase dextrously
turned or wrested to another purpose, has often the effect of the
liveliest wit. An idle fellow who had only fourpence left in the
world, which had been put by to pay for the baking some meat for
his dinner, went and laid it out to buy a new string for a guitar. An
old acquaintance on hearing this story, repeated those lines out of the
Allegro—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And ever against <i>eating</i> cares</div>
      <div class='line'>Lap me in soft Lydian airs.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The reply of the author of the periodical paper called the World to a
lady at church, who seeing him look thoughtful, asked what he was
thinking of—‘The next World,’—is a perversion of an established
formula of language, something of the same kind.—Rhymes are sometimes
a species of wit, where there is an alternate combination and
resolution or decomposition of the elements of sound, contrary to our
usual division and classification of them in ordinary speech, not unlike
the sudden separation and re-union of the component parts of the
machinery in a pantomime. The author who excels infinitely the
most in this way is the writer of Hudibras. He also excels in
the invention of single words and names which have the effect of wit
by sounding big, and meaning nothing:—‘full of sound and fury,
signifying nothing.’ But of the artifices of this author’s burlesque
style I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.—It is not always easy
to distinguish between the wit of words and that of things. ‘For
thin partitions do their bounds divide.’ Some of the late Mr.
Curran’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mots</span></i> or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</span></i>, might be said to owe their birth to
this sort of equivocal generation; or were a happy mixture of verbal
wit and a lively and picturesque fancy, of legal acuteness in detecting
the variable application of words, and of a mind apt at perceiving the
ludicrous in external objects. ‘Do you see any thing ridiculous in
this wig?’ said one of his brother judges to him. ‘Nothing but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>head,’ was the answer. Now here instantaneous advantage was taken
of the slight technical ambiguity in the construction of language, and
the matter-of-fact is flung into the scale as a thumping makeweight.
After all, verbal and accidental strokes of wit, though the most
surprising and laughable, are not the best and most lasting. That
wit is the most refined and effectual, which is founded on the detection
of unexpected likeness or distinction in things, rather than in words.
It is more severe and galling, that is, it is more unpardonable though
less surprising, in proportion as the thought suggested is more complete
and satisfactory, from its being inherent in the nature of the
things themselves. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hæret lateri lethalis arundo.</span></i> Truth makes the
greatest libel; and it is that which barbs the darts of wit. The
Duke of Buckingham’s saying, ‘Laws are not, like women, the worse
for being old,’ is an instance of a harmless truism and the utmost
malice of wit united. This is, perhaps, what has been meant
by the distinction between true and false wit. Mr. Addison, indeed,
goes so far as to make it the exclusive test of true wit that it will bear
translation into another language, that is to say, that it does not depend
at all on the form of expression. But this is by no means the case.
Swift would hardly have allowed of such a strait-laced theory, to
make havoc with his darling conundrums; though there is no one
whose serious wit is more that of things, as opposed to a mere play
either of words or fancy. I ought, I believe, to have noticed before,
in speaking of the difference between wit and humour, that wit is
often pretended absurdity, where the person overacts or exaggerates a
certain part with a conscious design to expose it as if it were another
person, as when Mandrake in the Twin Rivals says, ‘This glass is
too big, carry it away, I’ll drink out of the bottle.’ On the contrary,
when Sir Hugh Evans says very innocently, ‘’Od’s plessed will, I
will not be absence at the grace,’ though there is here a great deal of
humour, there is no wit. This kind of wit of the humorist, where
the person makes a butt of himself, and exhibits his own absurdities
or foibles purposely in the most pointed and glaring lights, runs
through the whole of the character of Falstaff, and is, in truth, the
principle on which it is founded. It is an irony directed against
one’s-self. Wit is, in fact, a voluntary act of the mind, or exercise
of the invention, shewing the absurd and ludicrous consciously,
whether in ourselves or another. Cross-readings, where the blunders
are designed, are wit: but if any one were to light upon them through
ignorance or accident, they would be merely ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c014'>It might be made an argument of the intrinsic superiority of poetry
or imagination to wit, that the former does not admit of mere verbal
combinations. Whenever they do occur, they are uniformly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>blemishes. It requires something more solid and substantial to raise
admiration or passion. The general forms and aggregate masses of
our ideas must be brought more into play, to give weight and magnitude.
Imagination may be said to be the finding out something
similar in things generally alike, or with like feelings attached to
them; while wit principally aims at finding out something that seems
the same, or amounts to a momentary deception where you least
expected it, viz. in things totally opposite. The reason why more
slight and partial, or merely accidental and nominal resemblances
serve the purposes of wit, and indeed characterise its essence as a
distinct operation and faculty of the mind, is, that the object of
ludicrous poetry is naturally to let down and lessen; and it is easier
to let down than to raise up, to weaken than to strengthen, to disconnect
our sympathy from passion and power, than to attach and
rivet it to any object of grandeur or interest, to startle and shock our
preconceptions by incongruous and equivocal combinations, than to
confirm, enforce, and expand them by powerful and lasting associations
of ideas, or striking and true analogies. A slight cause is
sufficient to produce a slight effect. To be indifferent or sceptical,
requires no effort; to be enthusiastic and in earnest, requires a strong
impulse, and collective power. Wit and humour (comparatively
speaking, or taking the extremes to judge of the gradations by)
appeal to our indolence, our vanity, our weakness, and insensibility;
serious and impassioned poetry appeals to our strength, our magnanimity,
our virtue, and humanity. Any thing is sufficient to heap
contempt upon an object; even the bare suggestion of a mischievous
allusion to what is improper, dissolves the whole charm, and puts an
end to our admiration of the sublime or beautiful. Reading the finest
passage in Milton’s Paradise Lost in a false tone, will make it seem
insipid and absurd. The cavilling at, or invidiously pointing out, a
few slips of the pen, will embitter the pleasure, or alter our opinion of
a whole work, and make us throw it down in disgust. The critics
are aware of this vice and infirmity in our nature, and play upon it
with periodical success. The meanest weapons are strong enough for
this kind of warfare, and the meanest hands can wield them. Spleen
can subsist on any kind of food. The shadow of a doubt, the hint
of an inconsistency, a word, a look, a syllable, will destroy our best-formed
convictions. What puts this argument in as striking a point
of view as any thing, is the nature of parody or burlesque, the secret
of which lies merely in transposing or applying at a venture to any
thing, or to the lowest objects, that which is applicable only to certain
given things, or to the highest matters. ‘From the sublime to the
ridiculous, there is but one step.’ The slightest want of unity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>impression destroys the sublime; the detection of the smallest incongruity
is an infallible ground to rest the ludicrous upon. But in
serious poetry, which aims at rivetting our affections, every blow must
tell home. The missing a single time is fatal, and undoes the spell.
We see how difficult it is to sustain a continued flight of impressive
sentiment: how easy it must be then to travestie or burlesque it, to
flounder into nonsense, and be witty by playing the fool. It is a
common mistake, however, to suppose that parodies degrade, or
imply a stigma on the subject: on the contrary, they in general imply
something serious or sacred in the originals. Without this, they
would be good for nothing; for the immediate contrast would be
wanting, and with this they are sure to tell. The best parodies are,
accordingly, the best and most striking things reversed. Witness the
common travesties of Homer and Virgil. Mr. Canning’s court
parodies on Mr. Southey’s popular odes, are also an instance in
point (I do not know which were the cleverest); and the best of the
Rejected Addresses is the parody on Crabbe, though I do not
certainly think that Crabbe is the most ridiculous poet now living.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lear and the Fool are the sublimest instance I know of passion
and wit united, or of imagination unfolding the most tremendous
sufferings, and of burlesque on passion playing with it, aiding and
relieving its intensity by the most pointed, but familiar and indifferent
illustrations of the same thing in different objects, and on a meaner
scale. The Fool’s reproaching Lear with ‘making his daughters his
mothers,’ his snatches of proverbs and old ballads, ‘The hedge-sparrow
fed the cuckoo so long, that it had its head bit off by its young,’ and
‘Whoop jug, I know when the horse follows the cart,’ are a running
commentary of trite truisms, pointing out the extreme folly of the
infatuated old monarch, and in a manner reconciling us to its inevitable
consequences.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lastly, there is a wit of sense and observation, which consists in
the acute illustration of good sense and practical wisdom, by means of
some far-fetched conceit or quaint imagery. The matter is sense, but
the form is wit. Thus the lines in Pope—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘’Tis with our judgments as our watches, none</div>
      <div class='line'>Go just alike; yet each believes his own——’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>are witty, rather than poetical; because the truth they convey is a
mere dry observation on human life, without elevation or enthusiasm,
and the illustration of it is of that quaint and familiar kind that is
merely curious and fanciful. Cowley is an instance of the same kind
in almost all his writings. Many of the jests and witticisms in the
best comedies are moral aphorisms and rules for the conduct of life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>sparkling with wit and fancy in the mode of expression. The ancient
philosophers also abounded in the same kind of wit, in telling home
truths in the most unexpected manner.—In this sense Æsop was the
greatest wit and moralist that ever lived. Ape and slave, he looked
askance at human nature, and beheld its weaknesses and errors transferred
to another species. Vice and virtue were to him as plain as any
objects of sense. He saw in man a talking, absurd, obstinate, proud,
angry animal; and clothed these abstractions with wings, or a beak, or
tail, or claws, or long ears, as they appeared embodied in these hieroglyphics
in the brute creation. His moral philosophy is natural
history. He makes an ass bray wisdom, and a frog croak humanity.
The store of moral truth, and the fund of invention in exhibiting it
in eternal forms, palpable and intelligible, and delightful to children
and grown persons, and to all ages and nations, are almost miraculous.
The invention of a fable is to me the most enviable exertion of human
genius: it is the discovering a truth to which there is no clue, and
which, when once found out, can never be forgotten. I would rather
have been the author of Æsop’s Fables, than of Euclid’s Elements!—That
popular entertainment, Punch and the Puppet-show, owes part
of its irresistible and universal attraction to nearly the same principle
of inspiring inanimate and mechanical agents with sense and consciousness.
The drollery and wit of a piece of wood is doubly droll
and farcical. Punch is not merry in himself, but ‘he is the cause of
heartfelt mirth in other men.’ The wires and pulleys that govern his
motions are conductors to carry off the spleen, and all ‘that perilous
stuff that weighs upon the heart.’ If we see a number of people
turning the corner of a street, ready to burst with secret satisfaction,
and with their faces bathed in laughter, we know what is the matter—that
they are just come from a puppet-show. Who can see three
little painted, patched-up figures, no bigger than one’s thumb, strut,
squeak and gibber, sing, dance, chatter, scold, knock one another about
the head, give themselves airs of importance, and ‘imitate humanity
most abominably,’ without laughing immoderately? We overlook the
farce and mummery of human life in little, and for nothing; and
what is still better, it costs them who have to play in it nothing. We
place the mirth, and glee, and triumph, to our own account; and we
know that the bangs and blows they have received go for nothing, as
soon as the showman puts them up in his box and marches off quietly
with them, as jugglers of a less amusing description sometimes march
off with the wrongs and rights of mankind in their pockets!—I have
heard no bad judge of such matters say, that ‘he liked a comedy
better than a tragedy, a farce better than a comedy, a pantomime
better than a farce, but a puppet-show best of all.’ I look upon it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that he who invented puppet-shows was a greater benefactor to his
species, than he who invented Operas!</p>

<p class='c014'>I shall conclude this imperfect and desultory sketch of wit and
humour with Barrow’s celebrated description of the same subject.
He says, ‘—But first it may be demanded, what the thing we speak
of is, or what this facetiousness doth import; to which question
I might reply, as Democritus did to him that asked the definition of
a man—<i>’tis that which we all see and know</i>; and one better
apprehends what it is by acquaintance, than I can inform him by
description. It is, indeed, a thing so versatile and multiform,
appearing in so many shapes, so many postures, so many garbs, so
variously apprehended by several eyes and judgments, that it seemeth
no less hard to settle a clear and certain notice thereof, than to make
a portrait of Proteus, or to define the figure of fleeting air. Sometimes
it lieth in pat allusion to a known story, or in seasonable
application of a trivial saying, or in forging an apposite tale: sometimes
it playeth in words and phrases, taking advantage from the
ambiguity of their sense, or the affinity of their sound: sometimes it
is wrapped in a dress of luminous expression; sometimes it lurketh
under an odd similitude. Sometimes it is lodged in a sly question, in
a smart answer; in a quirkish reason; in a shrewd intimation; in
cunningly diverting or cleverly restoring an objection: sometimes it
is couched in a bold scheme of speech; in a tart irony; in a lusty
hyperbole; in a startling metaphor; in a plausible reconciling of
contradictions, or in acute nonsense: sometimes a scenical representation
of persons or things, a counterfeit speech, a mimical look or
gesture passeth for it; sometimes an affected simplicity, sometimes a
presumptuous bluntness giveth it being: sometimes it riseth only from
a lucky hitting upon what is strange: sometimes from a crafty
wresting obvious matter to the purpose: often it consisteth in one
knows not what, and springeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways
are unaccountable and inexplicable, being answerable to the numberless
rovings of fancy and windings of language. It is, in short, a manner
of speaking out of the simple and plain way (such as reason teacheth
and knoweth things by), which by a pretty surprising uncouthness in
conceit or expression doth affect and amuse the fancy, shewing in it
some wonder, and breathing some delight thereto. It raiseth
admiration, as signifying a nimble sagacity of apprehension, a special
felicity of invention, a vivacity of spirit, and reach of wit more than
vulgar: it seeming to argue a rare quickness of parts, that one can
fetch in remote conceits applicable; a notable skill that he can
dextrously accommodate them to a purpose before him, together with
a lively briskness of humour, not apt to damp those sportful flashes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>imagination. (Whence in Aristotle such persons are termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἐπιδεξιοι</span>,
dexterous men and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εὐτροποι</span>, men of facile or versatile manners, who
can easily turn themselves to all things, or turn all things to themselves.)
It also procureth delight by gratifying curiosity with its
rareness or semblance of difficulty (as monsters, not for their beauty
but their rarity; as juggling tricks, not for their use but their
abstruseness, are beheld with pleasure;) by diverting the mind from
its road of serious thoughts; by instilling gaiety and airiness of spirit;
by provoking to such dispositions of spirit, in way of emulation or
complaisance, and by seasoning matter, otherwise distasteful or insipid,
with an unusual and thence grateful tang.’—<cite>Barrow’s Works, Serm. 14.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>I will only add by way of general caution, that there is nothing
more ridiculous than laughter without a cause, nor any thing more
troublesome than what are called laughing people. A professed
laugher is as contemptible and tiresome a character as a professed
wit: the one is always contriving something to laugh at, the other is
always laughing at nothing. An excess of levity is as impertinent as
an excess of gravity. A character of this sort is well personified by
Spenser, in the Damsel of the Idle Lake—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——Who did essay</div>
      <div class='line'>To laugh at shaking of the leavés light.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Any one must be mainly ignorant or thoughtless, who is surprised
at every thing he sees; or wonderfully conceited, who expects every
thing to conform to his standard of propriety. Clowns and idiots
laugh on all occasions; and the common failing of wishing to be
thought satirical often runs through whole families in country places,
to the great annoyance of their neighbours. To be struck with
incongruity in whatever comes before us, does not argue great comprehension
or refinement of perception, but rather a looseness and
flippancy of mind and temper, which prevents the individual from
connecting any two ideas steadily or consistently together. It is
owing to a natural crudity and precipitateness of the imagination,
which assimilates nothing properly to itself. People who are always
laughing, at length laugh on the wrong side of their faces; for they
cannot get others to laugh with them. In like manner, an affectation
of wit by degrees hardens the heart, and spoils good company and
good manners. A perpetual succession of good things puts an end to
common conversation. There is no answer to a jest, but another;
and even where the ball can be kept up in this way without ceasing,
it tires the patience of the by-standers, and runs the speakers out of
breath. Wit is the salt of conversation, not the food.</p>

<p class='c014'>The four chief names for comic humour out of our own language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>are Aristophanes and Lucian among the ancients, Moliere and
Rabelais among the moderns. Of the two first I shall say, for I
know but little. I should have liked Aristophanes better, if he had
treated Socrates less scurvily, for he has treated him most scurvily
both as to wit and argument. His Plutus and his Birds are striking
instances, the one of dry humour, the other of airy fancy.—Lucian
is a writer who appears to deserve his full fame: he has the licentious
and extravagant wit of Rabelais, but directed more uniformly to a
purpose; and his comic productions are interspersed with beautiful
and eloquent descriptions, full of sentiment, such as the exquisite
account of the fable of the halcyon put into the mouth of Socrates,
and the heroic eulogy on Bacchus, which is conceived in the highest
strain of glowing panegyric.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two other authors I proposed to mention are modern, and
French. Moliere, however, in the spirit of his writings, is almost
as much an English as a French author—quite a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbare</span></i> in all in
which he really excelled. He was unquestionably one of the greatest
comic geniuses that ever lived; a man of infinite wit, gaiety, and
invention—full of life, laughter, and whim. But it cannot be denied,
that his plays are in general mere farces, without scrupulous adherence
to nature, refinement of character, or common probability. The
plots of several of them could not be carried on for a moment without
a perfect collusion between the parties to wink at contradictions,
and act in defiance of the evidence of their senses. For instance,
take the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médecin malgré lui</span></i><a id='t28'></a> (the Mock Doctor), in which a common
wood-cutter takes upon himself, and is made successfully to support
through a whole play, the character of a learned physician, without
exciting the least suspicion; and yet, notwithstanding the absurdity
of the plot, it is one of the most laughable and truly comic productions
that can well be imagined. The rest of his lighter pieces,
the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bourgeois Gentilhomme</span></cite>, <cite>Monsieur Pourceaugnac</cite>, <cite>George Dandin</cite>, (or
Barnaby Brittle,) &amp;c. are of the same description—gratuitous assumptions
of character, and fanciful and outrageous caricatures of nature.
He indulges at his peril in the utmost license of burlesque exaggeration;
and gives a loose to the intoxication of his animal spirits. With
respect to his two most laboured comedies, the Tartuffe and
Misanthrope, I confess that I find them rather hard to get through:
they have much of the improbability and extravagance of the others,
united with the endless common-place prosing of French declamation.
What can exceed, for example, the absurdity of the Misanthrope,
who leaves his mistress, after every proof of her attachment and
constancy, for no other reason than that she will not submit to the
<i>technical formality</i> of going to live with him in a wilderness? The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>characters, again, which Celimene gives of her female friends, near
the opening of the play, are admirable satires, (as good as Pope’s
characters of women,) but not exactly in the spirit of comic dialogue.
The strictures of Rousseau on this play, in his Letter to D’Alembert,
are a fine specimen of the best philosophical criticism.—The same
remarks apply in a greater degree to the Tartuffe. The long
speeches and reasonings in this play tire one almost to death: they
may be very good logic, or rhetoric, or philosophy, or any thing but
comedy. If each of the parties had retained a special pleader to
speak his sentiments, they could have appeared more verbose or
intricate. The improbability of the character of Orgon is wonderful.
This play is in one point of view invaluable, as a lasting
monument of the credulity of the French to all verbal professions
of wisdom or virtue; and its existence can only be accounted for
from that astonishing and tyrannical predominance which words
exercise over things in the mind of every Frenchman. The <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole
des Femmes</span></cite>, from which Wycherley has borrowed his Country Wife,
with the true spirit of original genius, is, in my judgment, the
masterpiece of Moliere. The set speeches in the original play, it is
true, would not be borne on the English stage, nor indeed on the
French, but that they are carried off by the verse. The <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Critique de
l’Ecole des Femmes</span></cite>, the dialogue of which is prose, is written in a
very different style. Among other things, this little piece contains
an exquisite, and almost unanswerable defence of the superiority of
comedy over tragedy. Moliere was to be excused for taking this
side of the question.</p>

<p class='c014'>A writer of some pretensions among ourselves has reproached the
French with ‘an equal want of books and men.’ There is a common
French print, in which Moliere is represented reading one of his
plays in the presence of the celebrated Ninon de l’Enclos, to a circle
of the wits and first men of his own time. Among these are the
great Corneille; the tender, faultless Racine; Fontaine, the artless
old man, unconscious of immortality; the accomplished St. Evremond;
the Duke de La Rochefoucault, the severe anatomiser of the
human breast; Boileau, the flatterer of courts and judge of men!
Were these men nothing? They have passed for men (and great
ones) hitherto, and though the prejudice is an old one, I should hope
it may still last our time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Rabelais is another name that might have saved this unjust censure.
The wise sayings and heroic deeds of Gargantua and Pantagruel
ought not to be set down as nothing. I have already spoken my
mind at large of this author; but I cannot help thinking of him here,
sitting in his easy chair, with an eye languid with excess of mirth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>his lip quivering with a new-born conceit, and wiping his beard after
a well-seasoned jest, with his pen held carelessly in his hand, his
wine-flagons, and his books of law, of school divinity, and physic
before him, which were his jest-books, whence he drew endless
stores of absurdity; laughing at the world and enjoying it by turns,
and making the world laugh with him again, for the last three
hundred years, at his teeming wit and its own prolific follies. Even
to those who have never read his works, the name of Rabelais is a
cordial to the spirits, and the mention of it cannot consist with gravity
or spleen!</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE II<br /> <span class='c013'>ON SHAKSPEARE AND BEN JONSON</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>Dr. Johnson thought Shakspeare’s comedies better than his tragedies,
and gives as a reason, that he was more at home in the one than in the
other. That comedies should be written in a more easy and careless
vein than tragedies, is but natural. This is only saying that a comedy
is not so serious a thing as a tragedy. But that he shewed a greater
mastery in the one than the other, I cannot allow, nor is it generally
felt. The labour which the Doctor thought it cost Shakspeare to
write his tragedies, only shewed the labour which it cost the critic
in reading them, that is, his general indisposition to sympathise
heartily and spontaneously with works of high-wrought passion or
imagination. There is not in any part of this author’s writings the
slightest trace of his having ever been ‘smit with the love of sacred
song,’ except some passages in Pope. His habitually morbid
temperament and saturnine turn of thought required that the string
should rather be relaxed than tightened, that the weight upon the
mind should rather be taken off than have any thing added to it.
There was a sluggish moroseness about his moral constitution that
refused to be roused to any keen agony of thought, and that was not
very safely to be trifled with in lighter matters, though this last was
allowed to pass off as the most pardonable offence against the gravity
of his pretensions. It is in fact the established rule at present, in
these cases, to speak highly of the Doctor’s authority, and to dissent
from almost every one of his critical decisions. For my own part,
I so far consider this preference given to the comic genius of the
poet as erroneous and unfounded, that I should say that he is the
only tragic poet in the world in the highest sense, as being on a par
with, and the same as Nature, in her greatest heights and depths of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>action and suffering. There is but one who durst walk within that
mighty circle, treading the utmost bound of nature and passion,
shewing us the dread abyss of woe in all its ghastly shapes and
colours, and laying open all the faculties of the human soul to act,
to think, and suffer, in direst extremities; whereas I think, on the
other hand, that in comedy, though his talents there too were as
wonderful as they were delightful, yet that there were some before
him, others on a level with him, and many close behind him. I
cannot help thinking, for instance, that Moliere was as great, or a
greater comic genius than Shakspeare, though assuredly I do not
think that Racine was as great, or a greater tragic genius. I think
that both Rabelais and Cervantes, the one in the power of ludicrous
description, the other in the invention and perfect keeping of comic
character, excelled Shakspeare; that is, they would have been
greater men, if they had had equal power with him over the stronger
passions. For my own reading, I like Vanbrugh’s City Wives’
Confederacy as well, or (‘not to speak it profanely’) better than
the Merry Wives of Windsor, and Congreve’s Way of the World
as well as the Comedy of Errors or Love’s Labour Lost. But I
cannot say that I know of any tragedies in the world that make even
a tolerable approach to Hamlet, or Lear, or Othello, or some others,
either in the sum total of their effect, or in their complete distinctness
from every thing else, by which they take not only unquestioned,
but undivided possession of the mind, and form a class, a world by
themselves, mingling with all our thoughts like a second being.
Other tragedies tell for more or less, are good, bad, or indifferent,
as they have more or less excellence of a kind common to them with
others: but these stand alone by themselves; they have nothing
common-place in them; they are a new power in the imagination,
they tell for their whole amount, they measure from the ground.
There is not only nothing so good (in my judgment) as Hamlet, or
Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth, but there is nothing like Hamlet, or
Lear, or Othello, or Macbeth. There is nothing, I believe, in the
majestic Corneille, equal to the stern pride of Coriolanus, or which
gives such an idea of the crumbling in pieces of the Roman grandeur,
‘like an unsubstantial pageant faded,’ as the Antony and Cleopatra.
But to match the best serious comedies, such as Moliere’s Misanthrope
and his Tartuffe, we must go to Shakspeare’s tragic characters, the
Timon of Athens or honest Iago, when we shall more than succeed.
He put his strength into his tragedies, and played with comedy.
He was greatest in what was greatest; and his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> was not trifling,
according to the opinion here combated, even though he might do
that as well as any body else, unless he could do it better than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>body else.—I would not be understood to say that there are not
scenes or whole characters in Shakspeare equal in wit and drollery
to any thing upon record. Falstaff alone is an instance which, if I
would, I could not get over. ‘He is the leviathan of all the
creatures of the author’s comic genius, and tumbles about his unwieldy
bulk in an ocean of wit and humour.’ But in general it will
be found (if I am not mistaken) that even in the very best of these,
the spirit of humanity and the fancy of the poet greatly prevail over
the mere wit and satire, and that we sympathise with his characters
oftener than we laugh at them. His ridicule wants the sting of ill-nature.
He had hardly such a thing as spleen in his composition.
Falstaff himself is so great a joke, rather from his being so huge a
mass of enjoyment than of absurdity. His re-appearance in the
Merry Wives of Windsor is not ‘a consummation devoutly to be
wished,’ for we do not take pleasure in the repeated triumphs over
him.—Mercutio’s quips and banter upon his friends shew amazing
gaiety, frankness, and volubility of tongue, but we think no more of
them when the poet takes the words out of his mouth, and gives the
description of Queen Mab. Touchstone, again, is a shrewd biting
fellow, a lively mischievous wag: but still what are his gibing
sentences and chopped logic to the fine moralising vein of the
fantastical Jacques, stretched beneath ‘the shade of melancholy
boughs?’ Nothing. That is, Shakspeare was a greater poet than
wit: his imagination was the leading and master-quality of his mind,
which was always ready to soar into its native element: the ludicrous
was only secondary and subordinate. In the comedies of gallantry
and intrigue, with what freshness and delight we come to the serious
and romantic parts! What a relief they are to the mind, after those
of mere ribaldry or mirth! Those in Twelfth Night, for instance,
and Much Ado about Nothing, where Olivia and Hero are concerned,
throw even Malvolio and Sir Toby, and Benedick and
Beatrice, into the shade. They ‘give a very echo to the seat where
love is throned.’ What he has said of music might be said of his
own poetry—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh! it came o’er the ear like the sweet south</div>
      <div class='line'>Breathing upon a bank of violets,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stealing and giving odour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>How poor, in general, what a falling-off, these parts seem in mere
comic authors; how ashamed we are of them; and how fast we
hurry the blank verse over, that we may get upon safe ground again,
and recover our good opinion of the author! A striking and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>lamentable instance of this may be found (by any one who chooses)
in the high-flown speeches in Sir Richard Steele’s Conscious Lovers.—As
good an example as any of this informing and redeeming power
in our author’s genius might be taken from the comic scenes in both
parts of Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span> Nothing can go much lower in intellect or
morals than many of the characters. Here are knaves and fools in
abundance, of the meanest order, and stripped stark-naked. But
genius, like charity, ‘covers a multitude of sins:’ we pity as much
as we despise them; in spite of our disgust we like them, because
they like themselves, and because we are made to sympathise with
them; and the ligament, fine as it is, which links them to humanity,
is never broken. Who would quarrel with Wart or Feeble, or
Mouldy or Bull-calf, or even with Pistol, Nym, or Bardolph? None
but a hypocrite. The severe censurers of the morals of imaginary
characters can generally find a hole for their own vices to creep out
at; and yet do not perceive how it is that the imperfect and even
deformed characters in Shakspeare’s plays, as done to the life, by
forming a part of our personal consciousness, claim our personal
forgiveness, and suspend or evade our moral judgment, by bribing
our self-love to side with them. Not to do so, is not morality, but
affectation, stupidity, or ill-nature. I have more sympathy with one
of Shakspeare’s pick-purses, Gadshill or Peto, than I can possibly
have with any member of the Society for the Suppression of Vice,
and would by no means assist to deliver the one into the hands of
the other. Those who cannot be persuaded to draw a veil over the
foibles of ideal characters, may be suspected of wearing a mask over
their own! Again, in point of understanding and attainments,
Shallow sinks low enough; and yet his cousin Silence is a foil to
him; he is the shadow of a shade, glimmers on the very verge of
downright imbecility, and totters on the brink of nothing. ‘He has
been merry twice or once ere now,’ and is hardly persuaded to break
his silence in a song. Shallow has ‘heard the chimes at midnight,’
and roared out glees and catches at taverns and inns of court, when
he was young. So, at least, he tells his cousin Silence, and Falstaff
encourages the loftiness of his pretensions. Shallow would be thought
a great man among his dependents and followers; Silence is nobody—not
even in his own opinion: yet he sits in the orchard, and eats his
carraways and pippins among the rest. Shakspeare takes up the
meanest subjects with the same tenderness that we do an insect’s
wing, and would not kill a fly. To give a more particular instance
of what I mean, I will take the inimitable and affecting, though most
absurd and ludicrous dialogue, between Shallow and Silence, on the
death of old Double.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>‘<i>Shallow.</i> Come on, come on, come on; give me your hand, Sir; give
me your hand, Sir; an early stirrer, by the rood. And how doth my
good cousin Silence?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your fairest
daughter, and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> Alas, a black ouzel, cousin Shallow.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> By yea and nay, Sir; I dare say, my cousin William is become
a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> Indeed, Sir, to my cost.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> He must then to the Inns of Court shortly. I was once of
Clement’s-Inn; where, I think, they will talk of mad Shallow yet.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> You were called lusty Shallow then, cousin.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> I was called any thing, and I would have done any thing
indeed, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,
and black George Bare, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele a
Cotswold man, you had not four such swinge-bucklers in all the Inns
of Court again; and, I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas
were, and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was Jack
Falstaff (now Sir John, a boy,) and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke
of Norfolk.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> The same Sir John, the very same: I saw him break
Schoggan’s head at the court-gate, when he was a crack, not thus high;
and the very same day did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,
behind Gray’s-Inn. O, the mad days that I have spent! and to see how
many of mine old acquaintance are dead!</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> We shall all follow, cousin.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> Certain, ’tis certain, very sure, very sure: death (as the
Psalmist saith) is certain to all, all shall die.—How a good yoke of
bullocks at Stamford fair?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> Truly, cousin, I was not there.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living yet?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> Dead, Sir.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> Dead! see, see! he drew a good bow: and dead? he shot a
fine shoot. John of Gaunt loved him well, and betted much money on
his head. Dead! he would have clapped i’th’ clout at twelve score; and
carried you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a half, that it
would have done a man’s heart good to see.—How a score of ewes now?</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Silence.</i> Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be worth ten
pounds.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Shallow.</i> And is old Double dead?’</p>

<p class='c018'>There is not any thing more characteristic than this in all Shakspeare.
A finer sermon on mortality was never preached. We see the frail
condition of human life, and the weakness of the human understanding
in Shallow’s reflections on it; who, while the past is sliding
from beneath his feet, still clings to the present. The meanest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>circumstances are shewn through an atmosphere of abstraction that
dignifies them: their very insignificance makes them more affecting,
for they instantly put a check on our aspiring thoughts, and remind
us that, seen through that dim perspective, the difference between
the great and little, the wise and foolish, is not much. ‘One touch
of nature makes the whole world kin:’ and old Double, though his
exploits had been greater, could but have had his day. There is a
pathetic <i>naiveté</i> mixed up with Shallow’s common-place reflections
and impertinent digressions. The reader laughs (as well he may)
in reading the passage, but he lays down the book to think. The
wit, however diverting, is social and humane. But this is not the
distinguishing characteristic of wit, which is generally provoked by
folly, and spends its venom upon vice.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fault, then, of Shakspeare’s comic Muse is, in my opinion,
that it is too good-natured and magnanimous. It mounts above its
quarry. It is ‘apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery,
and delectable shapes:’ but it does not take the highest pleasure in
making human nature look as mean, as ridiculous, and contemptible
as possible. It is in this respect, chiefly, that it differs from the
comedy of a later, and (what is called) a more refined period.
Genteel comedy is the comedy of fashionable life, and of artificial
character and manners. The most pungent ridicule, is that which
is directed to mortify vanity, and to expose affectation; but vanity
and affectation, in their most exorbitant and studied excesses, are
the ruling principles of society, only in a highly advanced state of
civilisation and manners. Man can hardly be said to be a truly
contemptible animal, till, from the facilities of general intercourse,
and the progress of example and opinion, he becomes the ape of the
extravagances of other men. The keenest edge of satire is required
to distinguish between the true and false pretensions to taste and
elegance; its lash is laid on with the utmost severity, to drive before
it the common herd of knaves and fools, not to lacerate and terrify
the single stragglers. In a word, it is when folly is epidemic, and
vice worn as a mark of distinction, that all the malice of wit and
humour is called out and justified to detect the imposture, and prevent
the contagion from spreading. The fools in Wycherley and Congreve
are of their own, or one another’s making, and deserve to be well
scourged into common sense and decency: the fools in Shakspeare
are of his own or nature’s making; and it would be unfair to probe
to the quick, or hold up to unqualified derision, the faults which are
involuntary and incorrigible, or those which you yourself encourage
and exaggerate, from the pleasure you take in witnessing them. Our
later comic writers represent a state of manners, in which to be a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>man of wit and pleasure about town was become the fashion, and in
which the swarms of egregious pretenders in both kinds openly kept
one another in countenance, and were become a public nuisance.
Shakspeare, living in a state of greater rudeness and simplicity, chiefly
gave certain characters which were a kind of <i>grotesques</i>, or solitary
excrescences growing up out of their native soil without affectation,
and which he undertook kindly to pamper for the public entertainment.
For instance, Sir Andrew Aguecheek is evidently a creature
of the poet’s own fancy. The author lends occasion to his absurdity
to shew itself as much as he pleases, devises antics for him which
would not enter into his own head, makes him ‘go to church in a
galliard, and return home in a coranto;’ adds fuel to his folly, or
throws cold water on his courage; makes his puny extravagances
venture out or slink into corners without asking his leave; encourages
them into indiscreet luxuriance, or checks them in the bud, just as it
suits him for the jest’s sake. The gratification of the fancy, ‘and
furnishing matter for innocent mirth,’ are, therefore, the chief object
of this and other characters like it, rather than reforming the moral
sense, or indulging our personal spleen. But Tattle and Sparkish,
who are fops cast not in the mould of fancy, but of fashion, who have
a tribe of forerunners and followers, who catch certain diseases of the
mind on purpose to communicate the infection, and are screened in
their preposterous eccentricities by their own conceit and by the
world’s opinion, are entitled to no quarter, and receive none. They
think themselves objects of envy and admiration, and on that account
are doubly objects of our contempt and ridicule.—We find that the
scenes of Shakspeare’s comedies are mostly laid in the country, or
are transferable there at pleasure. The genteel comedy exists only
in towns, and crowds of borrowed characters, who copy others as the
satirist copies them, and who are only seen to be despised. ‘All
beyond Hyde Park is a desart to it:’ while there the pastoral and
poetic comedy begins to vegetate and flourish, unpruned, idle, and
fantastic. It is hard to ‘lay waste a country gentleman’ in a state of
nature, whose humours may have run a little wild or to seed, or to
lay violent hands on a young booby ‘squire, whose absurdities have
not yet arrived at years of discretion: but my Lord Foppington, who
is ‘the prince of coxcombs,’ and ‘proud of being at the head of so
prevailing a party,’ deserves his fate. I am not for going so far as to
pronounce Shakspeare’s ‘manners damnable, because he had not seen
the court;’ but I think that comedy does not find its richest harvest
till individual infirmities have passed into general manners, and it is
the example of courts, chiefly, that stamps folly with credit and
currency, or glosses over vice with meretricious lustre. I conceive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>therefore, that the golden period of our comedy was just after the age
of Charles ii. when the town first became tainted with the affectation
of the manners and conversation of fashionable life, and before the
distinction between rusticity and elegance, art and nature, was lost
(as it afterwards was) in a general diffusion of knowledge, and the
reciprocal advantages of civil intercourse. It is to be remarked, that
the union of the three gradations of artificial elegance and courtly
accomplishments in one class, of the affectation of them in another,
and of absolute rusticity in a third, forms the highest point of
perfection of the comedies of this period, as we may see in Vanbrugh’s
Lord Foppington, Sir Tunbelly Clumsy, and Miss Hoyden; Lady
Townly, Count Basset, and John Moody; in Congreve’s Millamant,
Lady Wishfort, Witwoud, Sir Wilful Witwoud, and the rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>In another point of view, or with respect to that part of comedy
which relates to gallantry and intrigue, the difference between
Shakspeare’s comic heroines and those of a later period may be
referred to the same distinction between natural and artificial life,
between the world of fancy and the world of fashion. The refinements
of romantic passion arise out of the imagination brooding over
‘airy nothing,’ or over a favourite object, where ‘love’s golden shaft
hath killed the flock of all affections else:’ whereas the refinements
of this passion in genteel comedy, or in every-day life, may be said to
arise out of repeated observation and experience, diverting and
frittering away the first impressions of things by a multiplicity of
objects, and producing, not enthusiasm, but fastidiousness or giddy
dissipation. For the one a comparatively rude age and strong
feelings are best fitted; for ‘there the mind must minister to itself:’
to the other, the progress of society and a knowledge of the world
are essential; for here the effect does not depend on leaving the mind
concentred in itself, but on the wear and tear of the heart, amidst
the complex and rapid movements of the artificial machinery of
society, and on the arbitrary subjection of the natural course of the
affections to every the slightest fluctuation of fashion, caprice, or
opinion. Thus Olivia, in Twelfth Night, has but one admirer of
equal rank with herself, and but one love, to whom she innocently
plights her hand and heart; or if she had a thousand lovers, she
would be the sole object of their adoration and burning vows, without
a rival. The heroine of romance and poetry sits secluded in the
bowers of fancy, sole queen and arbitress of all hearts; and as the
character is one of imagination, ‘of solitude and melancholy musing
born,’ so it may be best drawn from the imagination. Millamant, in
the Way of the World, on the contrary, who is the fine lady or
heroine of comedy, has so many lovers, that she surfeits on admiration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>till it becomes indifferent to her; so many rivals, that she is forced to
put on a thousand airs of languid affectation to mortify and vex them
more; so many offers, that she at last gives her hand to the man of
her heart, rather to escape the persecution of their addresses, and out
of levity and disdain, than from any serious choice of her own. This
is a comic character; its essence consists in making light of things
from familiarity and use, and as it is formed by habit and outward
circumstances, so it requires actual observation, and an acquaintance
with the modes of artificial life, to describe it with the utmost possible
grace and precision. Congreve, who had every other opportunity,
was but a young man when he wrote this character; and that makes
the miracle the greater.</p>

<p class='c014'>I do not, in short, consider comedy as exactly an affair of the
heart or the imagination; and it is for this reason only that I think
Shakspeare’s comedies deficient. I do not, however, wish to give a
preference of any comedies over his; but I do perceive a difference
between his comedies and some others that are, notwithstanding,
excellent in their way, and I have endeavoured to point out in what
this difference consists, as well as I could. Finally, I will not say
that he had not as great a natural genius for comedy as any one; but
I may venture to say, that he had not the same artificial models and
regulated mass of fashionable absurdity or elegance to work upon.</p>

<p class='c014'>The superiority of Shakspeare’s natural genius for comedy cannot
be better shewn than by a comparison between his comic characters
and those of Ben Jonson. The matter is the same: but how
different is the manner! The one gives fair-play to nature and his
own genius, while the other trusts almost entirely to imitation and
custom. Shakspeare takes his groundwork in individual character
and the manners of his age, and raises from them a fantastical and
delightful superstructure of his own: the other takes the same groundwork
in matter-of-fact, but hardly ever rises above it; and the more
he strives, is but the more enveloped ‘in the crust of formality’ and
the crude circumstantials of his subject. His genius (not to profane
an old and still venerable name, but merely to make myself understood)
resembles the grub more than the butterfly, plods and grovels
on, wants wings to wanton in the idle summer’s air, and catch the
golden light of poetry. Ben Jonson is a great borrower from the
works of others, and a plagiarist even from nature; so little freedom
is there in his imitations of her, and he appears to receive her bounty
like an alms. His works read like translations, from a certain cramp
manner, and want of adaptation. Shakspeare, even when he takes
whole passages from books, does it with a spirit, felicity, and mastery
over his subject, that instantly makes them his own; and shews more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>independence of mind and original thinking in what he plunders
without scruple, than Ben Jonson often did in his most studied
passages, forced from the sweat and labour of his brain. His style is
as dry, as literal, and meagre, as Shakspeare’s is exuberant, liberal,
and unrestrained. The one labours hard, lashes himself up, and
produces little pleasure with all his fidelity and tenaciousness of
purpose: the other, without putting himself to any trouble, or thinking
about his success, performs wonders,—</p>

      <div class='line'>As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bade him win all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There are people who cannot taste olives—and I cannot much relish
Ben Jonson, though I have taken some pains to do it, and went to
the task with every sort of good will. I do not deny his power or
his merit; far from it: but it is to me of a repulsive and unamiable
kind. He was a great man in himself, but one cannot readily
sympathise with him. His works, as the characteristic productions
of an individual mind, or as records of the manners of a particular age,
cannot be valued too highly; but they have little charm for the mere
general reader. Schlegel observes, that whereas Shakspeare gives
the springs of human nature, which are always the same, or sufficiently
so to be interesting and intelligible; Jonson chiefly gives the <i>humours</i>
of men, as connected with certain arbitrary or conventional modes of
dress, action, and expression, which are intelligible only while they
last, and not very interesting at any time. Shakspeare’s characters are
men; Ben Jonson’s are more like machines, governed by mere
routine, or by the convenience of the poet, whose property they are.
In reading the one, we are let into the minds of his characters, we
see the play of their thoughts, how their humours flow and work:
the author takes a range over nature, and has an eye to every object
or occasion that presents itself to set off and heighten the ludicrous
character he is describing. His humour (so to speak) bubbles,
sparkles, and finds its way in all directions, like a natural spring. In
Ben Jonson it is, as it were, confined in a leaden cistern, where it
stagnates and corrupts; or directed only through certain artificial
pipes and conduits, to answer a given purpose. The comedy of this
author is far from being ‘lively, audible, and full of vent:’ it is for
the most part obtuse, obscure, forced, and tedious. He wears out a
jest to the last shred and coarsest grain. His imagination fastens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>instinctively on some one mark or sign by which he designates the
individual, and never lets it go, for fear of not meeting with any other
means to express himself by. A cant phrase, an odd gesture, an old-fashioned
regimental uniform, a wooden leg, a tobacco-box, or a
hacked sword, are the standing topics by which he embodies his
characters to the imagination. They are cut and dried comedy; the
letter, not the spirit of wit and humour. Each of his characters has
a particular cue, a professional badge which he wears and is known
by, and by nothing else. Thus there is no end of Captain Otter, his
Bull, his Bear, and his Horse, which are no joke at first, and do not
become so by being repeated twenty times. It is a mere matter of
fact, that some landlord of his acquaintance called his drinking cups
by these ridiculous names; but why need we be told so more than
once, or indeed at all? There is almost a total want of variety,
fancy, relief, and of those delightful transitions which abound, for
instance, in Shakspeare’s tragi-comedy. In Ben Jonson, we find
ourselves generally in low company, and we see no hope of getting out
of it. He is like a person who fastens upon a disagreeable subject,
and cannot be persuaded to leave it. His comedy, in a word, has
not what Shakspeare somewhere calls ‘bless’d conditions.’ It is
cross-grained, mean, and mechanical. It is handicraft wit. Squalid
poverty, sheer ignorance, bare-faced impudence, or idiot imbecility,
are his dramatic common-places—things that provoke pity or disgust,
instead of laughter. His portraits are caricatures by dint of their
very likeness, being extravagant tautologies of themselves; as his plots
are improbable by an excess of consistency; for he goes thoroughstitch
with whatever he takes in hand, makes one contrivance answer
all purposes, and every obstacle give way to a predetermined theory.
For instance, nothing can be more incredible than the mercenary
conduct of Corvino, in delivering up his wife to the palsied embraces
of Volpone; and yet the poet does not seem in the least to boggle at
the incongruity of it: but the more it is in keeping with the absurdity
of the rest of the fable, and the more it advances it to an incredible
catastrophe, the more he seems to dwell upon it with complacency
and a sort of wilful exaggeration, as if it were a logical discovery or
corollary from well-known premises. He would no more be baffled
in the working out a plot, than some people will be baffled in an
argument. ‘If to be wise were to be obstinate,’ our author might
have laid signal claim to this title. Old Ben was of a scholastic
turn, and had dealt a little in the occult sciences and controversial
divinity. He was a man of strong crabbed sense, retentive memory,
acute observation, great fidelity of description and keeping in character,
a power of working out an idea so as to make it painfully true and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>oppressive, and with great honesty and manliness of feeling, as well
as directness of understanding: but with all this, he wanted, to my
thinking, that genial spirit of enjoyment and finer fancy, which
constitute the essence of poetry and of wit. The sense of reality
exercised a despotic sway over his mind, and equally weighed down
and clogged his perception of the beautiful or the ridiculous. He had
a keen sense of what was true and false, but not of the difference
between the agreeable and disagreeable; or if he had, it was by his
understanding rather than his imagination, by rule and method, not
by sympathy, or intuitive perception of ‘the gayest, happiest attitude
of things.’ There was nothing spontaneous, no impulse or ease about
his genius: it was all forced, up-hill work, making a toil of a pleasure.
And hence his overweening admiration of his own works, from the
effort they had cost him, and the apprehension that they were not
proportionably admired by others, who knew nothing of the pangs
and throes of his Muse in child-bearing. In his satirical descriptions
he seldom stops short of the lowest and most offensive point of
meanness; and in his serious poetry he seems to repose with complacency
only on the pedantic and far-fetched, the <i>ultima Thule</i> of his
knowledge. He has a conscience of letting nothing escape the
reader that he knows. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aliquando sufflaminandus erat</span></i>, is as true of
him as it was of Shakspeare, but in a quite different sense. He is
doggedly bent upon fatiguing you with a favourite idea; whereas,
Shakspeare overpowers and distracts attention by the throng and
indiscriminate variety of his. His Sad Shepherd is a beautiful fragment.
It was a favourite with the late Mr. Horne Tooke: indeed
it is no wonder, for there was a sort of sympathy between the two
men. Ben was like the modern wit and philosopher, a grammarian
and a hard-headed thinker.—There is an amusing account of Ben
Jonson’s private manners in Howel’s Letters, which is not generally
known, and which I shall here extract.</p>

extremely of himself, and, by vilifying others, to magnify his own Muse.
T. Ca. (Tom Carew) buzzed me in the ear, that though Ben had barrelled
up a great deal of knowledge, yet it seems he had not read the ethics,
which, among other precepts of morality, forbid self-commendation,
declaring it to be an ill-favoured solecism in good manners. It made me

<p class='c023'>The concurring testimony of all his contemporaries agrees with his

begins, for instance, an epistle to Drayton in these words—</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Of Shakspeare’s comedies I have already given a detailed account,
which is before the public, and which I shall not repeat of course:
but I shall give a cursory sketch of the principal of Ben Jonson’s.—The
Silent Woman is built upon the supposition of an old citizen
disliking noise, who takes to wife Epicene (a supposed young lady)
for the reputation of her silence, and with a view to disinherit his
nephew, who has laughed at his infirmity; when the ceremony is no
sooner over than the bride turns out a very shrew, his house becomes
a very Babel of noises, and he offers his nephew his own terms to
unloose the matrimonial knot, which is done by proving that Epicene
is no woman. There is some humour in the leading character, but
too much is made out of it, not in the way of Moliere’s exaggerations,
which, though extravagant, are fantastical and ludicrous, but of
serious, plodding, minute prolixity. The first meeting between
Morose and Epicene is well managed, and does not ‘o’erstep the
modesty of nature,’ from the very restraint imposed by the situation
of the parties—by the affected taciturnity of the one, and the
other’s singular dislike of noise. The whole story, from the
beginning to the end, is a gratuitous assumption, and the height of
improbability. The author, in sustaining the weight of his plot,
seems like a balance-master who supports a number of people, piled
one upon another, on his hands, his knees, his shoulders, but with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>great effort on his own part, and with a painful effect to the beholders.
The scene between Sir Amorous La Foole and Sir John Daw, in
which they are frightened by a feigned report of each other’s courage,
into a submission to all sorts of indignities, which they construe into
flattering civilities, is the same device as that in Twelfth Night
between Sir Andrew Aguecheek and Viola, carried to a paradoxical
and revolting excess. Ben Jonson had no idea of decorum in his
dramatic fictions, which Milton says is the principal thing, but went
on caricaturing himself and others till he could go no farther in
extravagance, and sink no lower in meanness. The titles of his
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i>, such as Sir Amorous La Foole, Truewit, Sir John
Daw, Sir Politic Would-be, &amp;c. &amp;c. which are significant and knowing,
shew his determination to overdo every thing by thus letting you into
their characters beforehand, and afterwards proving their pretensions
by their names. Thus Peregrine, in Volpone, says, ‘Your name,
Sir? <i>Politick.</i> My name is Politick Would-be.’ To which
Peregrine replies, ‘Oh, that speaks him.’ How it should, if it was
his real name, and not a nick-name given him on purpose by the
author, is hard to conceive. This play was Dryden’s favourite.
It is indeed full of sharp, biting sentences against the women, of
which he was fond. The following may serve as a specimen.
Truewit says, ‘Did I not tell thee, Dauphine? Why, all their
actions are governed by crude opinion, without reason or cause:
they know not why they do any thing; but, as they are informed,
believe, judge, praise, condemn, love, hate, and in emulation one of
another, do all these things alike. Only they have a natural inclination
sways ’em generally to the worst, when they are left to themselves.’
This is a cynical sentence; and we may say of the rest of
his opinions, that ‘even though we should hold them to be true, yet
it is slander to have them so set down.’ The women in this play
indeed justify the author’s severity; they are altogether abominable.
They have an utter want of principle and decency, and are equally
without a sense of pleasure, taste, or elegance. Madame Haughty,
Madame Centaur, and Madame Mavis, form the College, as it is
here pedantically called. They are a sort of candidates for being
upon the town, but cannot find seducers, and a sort of blue-stockings,
before the invention of letters. Mistress Epicene, the silent gentlewoman,
turns out not to be a woman at all; which is not a very
pleasant <i>denouement</i> of the plot, and is itself an incident apparently
taken from the blundering blindman’s-buff conclusion of the Merry
Wives of Windsor. What Shakspeare might introduce by an
accident, and as a mere passing jest, Ben Jonson would set about
building a whole play upon. The directions for making love given
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>by Truewit, the author’s favourite, discover great knowledge and
shrewdness of observation, mixed with the acuteness of malice, and
approach to the best style of comic dialogue. But I must refer to
the play itself for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Fox, or Volpone, is his best play. It is prolix and improbable,
but intense and powerful. It is written <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>. It is
made up of cheats and dupes, and the author is at home among
them. He shews his hatred of the one and contempt for the other,
and makes them set one another off to great advantage. There are
several striking dramatic contrasts in this play, where the Fox lies
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perdue</span></i> to watch his prey, where Mosca is the dextrous go-between
outwitting his gulls, his employer, and himself, and where each of
the gaping legacy-hunters, the lawyer, the merchant, and the miser,
eagerly occupied with the ridiculousness of the other’s pretensions,
is blind only to the absurdity of his own: but the whole is worked
up too mechanically, and our credulity overstretched at last revolts
into scepticism, and our attention overtasked flags into drowsiness.
This play seems formed on the model of Plautus, in unity of plot
and interest; and old Ben, in emulating his classic model, appears
to have done his best. There is the same caustic unsparing severity
in it as in his other works. His patience is tried to the utmost.
His words drop gall.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>‘Hood an ass with reverend purple,</div>

      <div class='line'>And he shall pass for a cathedral doctor.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The scene between Volpone, Mosca, Voltore, Corvino, and
Corbaccio, at the outset, will shew the dramatic power in the
conduct of this play, and will be my justification in what I have said
of the literal tenaciousness (to a degree that is repulsive) of the
author’s imaginary descriptions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every Man in his Humour, is a play well-known to the public.
This play acts better than it reads. The pathos in the principal
character, Kitely, is ‘as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage.’
There is, however, a certain good sense, discrimination, or logic of
passion in the part, which affords excellent hints for an able actor,
and which, if properly pointed, gives it considerable force on the
stage. Bobadil is the only actually striking character in the play,
and the real hero of the piece. His well-known proposal for the
pacification of Europe, by killing some twenty of them, each his man
a day, is as good as any other that has been suggested up to the
present moment. His extravagant affectation, his blustering and
cowardice, are an entertaining medley; and his final defeat and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>exposure, though exceedingly humorous, are the most affecting part
of the story. Brain-worm is a particularly dry and abstruse character.
We neither know his business nor his motives: his plots are as
intricate as they are useless, and as the ignorance of those he imposes
upon is wonderful. This is the impression in reading it. Yet from
the bustle and activity of this character on the stage, the changes of
dress, the variety of affected tones and gipsy jargon, and the limping
affected gestures, it is a very amusing theatrical exhibition. The rest,
Master Matthew, Master Stephen, Cob and Cob’s wife, were living
in the sixteenth century. That is all we all know of them. But from
the very oddity of their appearance and behaviour, they have a very
droll and even picturesque effect when acted. It seems a revival of
the dead. We believe in their existence when we see them. As
an example of the power of the stage in giving reality and interest
to what otherwise would be without it, I might mention the scene
in which Brain-worm praises Master Stephen’s leg. The folly here is
insipid from its being seemingly carried to an excess, till we see it;
and then we laugh the more at it, the more incredible we thought it
before.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bartholomew Fair is chiefly remarkable for the exhibition of odd
humours and tumbler’s tricks, and is on that account amusing to read
once.—The Alchymist is the most famous of this author’s comedies,
though I think it does not deserve its reputation. It contains all
that is quaint, dreary, obsolete, and hopeless in this once-famed art,
but not the golden dreams and splendid disappointments. We have
the mere circumstantials of the sublime science, pots and kettles,
aprons and bellows, crucibles and diagrams, all the refuse and rubbish,
not the essence, the true <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">elixir vitæ</span></i>. There is, however, one glorious
scene between Surly and Sir Epicure Mammon, which is the finest
example I know of dramatic sophistry, or of an attempt to prove the
existence of a thing by an imposing description of its effects; but
compared with this, the rest of the play is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i>. The
scene I allude to is the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c014'>I have only to add a few words on Beaumont and Fletcher. Rule
a Wife and Have a Wife, the Chances, and the Wild Goose Chase,
the original of the Inconstant, are superior in style and execution to
any thing of Ben Jonson’s. They are, indeed, some of the best
comedies on the stage; and one proof that they are so, is, that they
still hold possession of it. They shew the utmost alacrity of invention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>in contriving ludicrous distresses, and the utmost spirit in
bearing up against, or impatience and irritation under them. Don
John, in the Chances, is the heroic in comedy. Leon, in Rule a
Wife and Have a Wife, is a fine exhibition of the born gentleman
and natural fool: the Copper Captain is sterling to this hour: his
mistress, Estifania, only died the other day with Mrs. Jordan: and
the two grotesque females, in the same play, act better than the
Witches in Macbeth.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE III<br /> <span class='c013'>ON COWLEY, BUTLER, SUCKLING, ETHEREGE, &amp;C.</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>The metaphysical poets or wits of the age of James and Charles I.
whose style was adopted and carried to a more dazzling and fantastic
excess by Cowley in the following reign, after which it declined, and
gave place almost entirely to the poetry of observation and reasoning,
are thus happily characterised by Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘The metaphysical poets were men of learning, and to show their
learning was their whole endeavour: but unluckily resolving to show
it in rhyme, instead of writing poetry, they only wrote verses, and
very often such verses as stood the trial of the finger better than of
the ear; for the modulation was so imperfect, that they were only
found to be verses by counting the syllables.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘If the father of criticism has rightly denominated poetry <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τέχνη
μιμητικὴ</span>, <i>an imitative art</i>, these writers will, without great wrong,
lose their right to the name of poets, for they cannot be said to have
imitated any thing; they neither copied nature nor life; neither painted
the forms of matter, nor represented the operations of intellect.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole of the account is well worth reading: it was a subject
for which Dr. Johnson’s powers both of thought and expression were
better fitted than any other man’s. If he had had the same capacity
for following the flights of a truly poetic imagination, or for feeling
the finer touches of nature, that he had felicity and force in detecting
and exposing the aberrations from the broad and beaten path of
propriety and common sense, he would have amply deserved the
reputation he has acquired as a philosophical critic.</p>

<p class='c014'>The writers here referred to (such as Donne, Davies, Crashaw,
and others) not merely mistook learning for poetry—they thought
any thing was poetry that differed from ordinary prose and the
natural impression of things, by being intricate, far-fetched, and
improbable. Their style was not so properly learned as metaphysical;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>that is to say, whenever, by any violence done to their ideas, they
could make out an abstract likeness or possible ground of comparison,
they forced the image, whether learned or vulgar, into the service of
the Muses. Any thing would do to ‘hitch into a rhyme,’ no matter
whether striking or agreeable, or not, so that it would puzzle the
reader to discover the meaning, and if there was the most remote
circumstance, however trifling or vague, for the pretended comparison
to hinge upon. They brought ideas together not the most, but the
least like; and of which the collision produced not light, but
obscurity—served not to strengthen, but to confound. Their
mystical verses read like riddles or an allegory. They neither
belong to the class of lively or severe poetry. They have not the
force of the one, nor the gaiety of the other; but are an ill-assorted,
unprofitable union of the two together, applying to serious subjects
that quaint and partial style of allusion which fits only what is light
and ludicrous, and building the most laboured conclusions on the
most fantastical and slender premises. The object of the poetry of
imagination is to raise or adorn one idea by another more striking or
more beautiful: the object of these writers was to match any one
idea with any other idea, <i>for better for worse</i>, as we say, and whether
any thing was gained by the change of condition or not. The object
of the poetry of the passions again is to illustrate any strong feeling,
by shewing the same feeling as connected with objects or circumstances
more palpable and touching; but here the object was to strain
and distort the immediate feeling into some barely possible consequence
or recondite analogy, in which it required the utmost stretch
of misapplied ingenuity to trace the smallest connection with the
original impression. In short, the poetry of this period was strictly
the poetry not of ideas, but of <i>definitions</i>: it proceeded in mode and
figure, by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus</span></i> and specific difference; and was the logic of the
schools, or an oblique and forced construction of dry, literal matter-of-fact,
decked out in a robe of glittering conceits, and clogged with
the halting shackles of verse. The imagination of the writers, instead
of being conversant with the face of nature, or the secrets of the
heart, was lost in the labyrinths of intellectual abstraction, or entangled
in the technical quibbles and impertinent intricacies of
language. The complaint so often made, and here repeated, is not
of the want of power in these men, but of the waste of it; not of
the absence of genius, but the abuse of it. They had (many of
them) great talents committed to their trust, richness of thought, and
depth of feeling; but they chose to hide them (as much as they
possibly could) under a false shew of learning and unmeaning subtlety.
From the style which they had systematically adopted, they thought
nothing done till they had perverted simplicity into affectation, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>spoiled nature by art. They seemed to think there was an irreconcileable
opposition between genius, as well as grace, and nature;
tried to do without, or else constantly to thwart her; left nothing to
her outward ‘impress,’ or spontaneous impulses, but made a point of
twisting and torturing almost every subject they took in hand, till
they had fitted it to the mould of their self-opinion and the previous
fabrications of their own fancy, like those who pen acrostics in the
shape of pyramids, and cut out trees into the shape of peacocks.
Their chief aim is to make you wonder at the writer, not to interest
you in the subject; and by an incessant craving after admiration, they
have lost what they might have gained with less extravagance and
affectation. So Cowper, who was of a quite opposite school, speaks
feelingly of the misapplication of Cowley’s poetical genius.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And though reclaim’d by modern lights</div>
      <div class='line'>From an erroneous taste,</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot but lament thy splendid wit</div>
      <div class='line'>Entangled in the cobwebs of the schools.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Donne, who was considerably before Cowley, is without his fancy,
but was more recondite in his logic, and rigid in his descriptions.
He is hence led, particularly in his satires, to tell disagreeable
truths in as disagreeable a way as possible, or to convey a pleasing
and affecting thought (of which there are many to be found in his
other writings) by the harshest means, and with the most painful
effort. His Muse suffers continual pangs and throes. His thoughts
are delivered by the Cæsarean operation. The sentiments, profound
and tender as they often are, are stifled in the expression; and
‘heaved pantingly forth,’ are ‘buried quick again’ under the ruins
and rubbish of analytical distinctions. It is like poetry waking from
a trance: with an eye bent idly on the outward world, and half-forgotten
feelings crowding about the heart; with vivid impressions,
dim notions, and disjointed words. The following may serve as
instances of beautiful or impassioned reflections losing themselves in
obscure and difficult applications. He has some lines to a Blossom,
which begin thus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Little think’st thou, poor flow’r,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom I have watched six or seven days,</div>
      <div class='line'>And seen thy birth, and seen what every hour</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave to thy growth, thee to this height to raise,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now dost laugh and triumph on this bough.</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Little think’st thou</div>
      <div class='line'>That it will freeze anon, and that I shall</div>
      <div class='line'>To-morrow find thee fall’n, or not at all.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>This simple and delicate description is only introduced as a foundation
for an elaborate metaphysical conceit as a parallel to it, in the
next stanza.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Little think’st thou (poor heart</div>
      <div class='line'>That labour’st yet to nestle thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>And think’st by hovering here to get a part</div>
      <div class='line'>In a forbidden or forbidding tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>And hop’st her stiffness by long siege to bow:)</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Little think’st thou,</div>
      <div class='line'>That thou to-morrow, ere the sun doth wake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Must with this sun and me a journey take.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This is but a lame and impotent conclusion from so delightful a
beginning.—He thus notices the circumstance of his wearing his
late wife’s hair about his arm, in a little poem which is called the
Funeral:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Nor question much</div>
      <div class='line'>That subtle wreath of hair, about mine arm;</div>
      <div class='line'>The mystery, the sign you must not touch.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The scholastic reason he gives quite dissolves the charm of tender
and touching grace in the sentiment itself—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘For ’tis my outward soul,</div>
      <div class='line'>Viceroy to that, which unto heaven being gone,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Will leave this to control,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Again, the following lines, the title of which is Love’s Deity, are
highly characteristic of this author’s manner, in which the thoughts
are inlaid in a costly but imperfect mosaic-work.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>I long to talk with some old lover’s ghost,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Who died before the God of Love was born</i>:</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot think that he, who then lov’d most,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sunk so low, as to love one which did scorn.</div>
      <div class='line'>But since this God produc’d a destiny,</div>
      <div class='line'>And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be;</div>
      <div class='line'>I must love her that loves not me.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The stanza in the Epithalamion on a Count Palatine of the Rhine,
has been often quoted against him, and is an almost irresistible
illustration of the extravagances to which this kind of writing,
which turns upon a pivot of words and possible allusions, is liable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Speaking of the bride and bridegroom he says, by way of serious
compliment—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>‘Here lies a she-Sun, and a he-Moon there,</div>
      <div class='line'>She gives the best light to his sphere;</div>
      <div class='line'>Or each is both and all, and so</div>
      <div class='line'>They unto one another nothing owe.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>His love-verses and epistles to his friends give the most favourable
idea of Donne. His satires are too clerical. He shews, if I may
so speak, too much disgust, and, at the same time, too much contempt
for vice. His dogmatical invectives hardly redeem the nauseousness
of his descriptions, and compromise the imagination of his readers
more than they assist their reason. The satirist does not write with
the same authority as the divine, and should use his poetical privileges
more sparingly. ‘To the pure all things are pure,’ is a maxim
which a man like Dr. Donne may be justified in applying to
himself; but he might have recollected that it could not be construed
to extend to the generality of his readers, <i>without benefit of
clergy</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bishop Hall’s Satires are coarse railing in verse, and hardly that.
Pope has, however, contrived to avail himself of them in some of his
imitations.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sir John Davies is the author of a poem on the Soul, and of one
on Dancing. In both he shews great ingenuity, and sometimes
terseness and vigour. In the last of these two poems his fancy
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirouettes</span></i> in a very lively and agreeable manner, but something too
much in the style of a French opera-dancer, with sharp angular
turns, and repeated deviations from the faultless line of simplicity
and nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Crashaw was a writer of the same ambitious stamp, whose imagination
was rendered still more inflammable by the fervors of fanaticism,
and who having been converted from Protestantism to Popery (a
weakness to which the ‘seething brains’ of the poets of this period
were prone) by some visionary appearance of the Virgin Mary,
poured out his devout raptures and zealous enthusiasm in a torrent
of poetical hyperboles. The celebrated Latin Epigram on the
miracle of our Saviour, ‘The water blushed into wine,’ is in his
usual <i>hectic</i> manner. His translation of the contest between the
Musician and the Nightingale is the best specimen of his powers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Davenant’s Gondibert is a tissue of stanzas, all aiming to be wise
and witty, each containing something in itself, and the whole together
amounting to nothing. The thoughts separately require so much
attention to understand them, and arise so little out of the narrative,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>that they with difficulty sink into the mind, and have no common
feeling of interest to recal or link them together afterwards. The
general style may be judged of by these two memorable lines in the
description of the skeleton-chamber.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Yet on that wall hangs he too, who so thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And she dried by him whom that he obeyed.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Hobbes, in a prefatory discourse, has thrown away a good deal
of powerful logic and criticism in recommendation of the plan of his
friend’s poem. Davenant, who was poet-laureate to Charles II. wrote
several masques and plays which were well received in his time, but
have not come down with equal applause to us.</p>

<p class='c014'>Marvel (on whom I have already bestowed such praise as I could,
for elegance and tenderness in his descriptive poems) in his satires
and witty pieces was addicted to the affected and involved style here
reprobated, as in his Flecknoe (the origin of Dryden’s Macflecknoe)
and in his satire on the Dutch. As an instance of this forced, far-fetched
method of treating his subject, he says, in ridicule of the
Hollanders, that when their dykes overflowed, the fish used to come
to table with them,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And sat not as a meat, but as a guest.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There is a poem of Marvel’s on the death of King Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> which
I have not seen, but which I have heard praised by one whose praise
is never high but of the highest things, for the beauty and pathos, as
well as generous frankness of the sentiments, coming, as they did,
from a determined and incorruptible political foe.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shadwell was a successful and voluminous dramatic writer of much
the same period. His Libertine (taken from the celebrated Spanish
story) is full of spirit; but it is the spirit of licentiousness and
impiety. At no time do there appear to have been such extreme
speculations afloat on the subject of religion and morality, as there
were shortly after the Reformation, and afterwards under the Stuarts,
the differences being widened by political irritation; and the Puritans
often over-acting one extreme out of grimace and hypocrisy, as the
king’s party did the other out of <i>bravado</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Carew is excluded from his pretensions to the laureateship in
Suckling’s Sessions of the Poets, on account of his slowness. His
verses are delicate and pleasing, with a certain feebleness, but with
very little tincture of the affectation of this period. His masque
(called <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cœlum Britannicum</span></cite>) in celebration of a marriage at court,
has not much wit nor fancy, but the accompanying prose directions
and commentary on the mythological story, are written with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>wonderful facility and elegance, in a style of familiar dramatic
dialogue approaching nearer the writers of Queen Anne’s reign than
those of Queen Elizabeth’s.</p>

<p class='c014'>Milton’s name is included by Dr. Johnson in the list of metaphysical
poets on no better authority than his lines on Hobson the
Cambridge Carrier, which he acknowledges were the only ones
Milton wrote on this model. Indeed, he is the great contrast to
that style of poetry, being remarkable for breadth and massiness, or
what Dr. Johnson calls ‘aggregation of ideas,’ beyond almost any
other poet. He has in this respect been compared to Michael
Angelo, but not with much reason: his verses are</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>——‘inimitable on earth</div>
      <div class='line'>By model, or by shading pencil drawn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Suckling is also ranked, without sufficient warrant, among the
metaphysical poets. Sir John was of ‘the court, courtly;’ and his
style almost entirely free from the charge of pedantry and affectation.
There are a few blemishes of this kind in his works, but they are
but few. His compositions are almost all of them short and lively
effusions of wit and gallantry, written in a familiar but spirited style,
without much design or effort. His shrewd and taunting address to
a desponding lover will sufficiently vouch for the truth of this account
of the general cast of his best pieces.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Why so pale and wan, fond lover?</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Pr’ythee why so pale?</div>

      <div class='line in6'>Looking ill prevail?</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Pr’ythee why so pale?</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Quit, quit for shame, this will not move,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>This cannot take her;</div>

      <div class='line in6'>Nothing can make her;</div>
      <div class='line in6'>The Devil take her.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The two short poems against Fruition, that beginning, ‘There
never yet was woman made, nor shall, but to be curst,’—the song,
‘I pr’ythee, spare me, gentle boy, press me no more for that slight
toy, that foolish trifle of a heart,’—another, ‘’Tis now, since I sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>down before, that foolish fort, a heart,’—<i>Lutea Alanson</i>—the set of
similes, ‘Hast thou seen the down in the air, when wanton winds
have tost it,’—and his ‘Dream,’ which is of a more tender and
romantic cast, are all exquisite in their way. They are the origin
of the style of Prior and Gay in their short fugitive verses, and of
the songs in the Beggar’s Opera. His Ballad on a Wedding is his
masterpiece, and is indeed unrivalled in that class of composition,
for the voluptuous delicacy of the sentiments, and the luxuriant
richness of the images. I wish I could repeat the whole, but that,
from the change of manners, is impossible. The description of the
bride is (half of it) as follows: the story is supposed to be told by
one countryman to another:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Her finger was so small, the ring</div>

      <div class='line'>It look’d like the great collar (just)</div>
      <div class='line in4'>About our young colt’s neck.</div>

    <div class='group'>

      <div class='line'>But oh! she dances such a way!</div>
      <div class='line'>No sun upon an Easter-day</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Is half so fine a sight.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>There is to me in the whole of this delightful performance a freshness
and purity like the first breath of morning. Its sportive irony
never trespasses on modesty, though it sometimes (laughing) threatens
to do so! Suckling’s Letters are full of habitual gaiety and good
sense. His Discourse on Reason in Religion is well enough meant.
Though he excelled in the conversational style of poetry, writing
verse with the freedom and readiness, vivacity and unconcern, with
which he would have talked on the most familiar and sprightly topics,
his peculiar powers deserted him in attempting dramatic dialogue.
His comedy of the <cite>Goblins</cite> is equally defective in plot, wit, and
nature; it is a wretched list of <i>exits</i> and <i>entrances</i>, and the whole
business of the scene is taken up in the unaccountable seizure, and
equally unaccountable escapes, of a number of persons from a band of
robbers in the shape of goblins, who turn out to be noblemen and
gentlemen in disguise. Suckling was not a Grub-street author; or
it might be said, that this play is like what he might have written
after dreaming all night of duns and a spunging-house. His tragedies
are no better: their titles are the most interesting part of them,
Aglaura, Brennoralt, and the Sad One.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cowley had more brilliancy of fancy and ingenuity of thought than
Donne, with less pathos and sentiment. His mode of illustrating his
ideas differs also from Donne’s in this: that whereas Donne is contented
to analyse an image into its component elements, and resolve
it into its most abstracted species; Cowley first does this, indeed,
but does not stop till he has fixed upon some other prominent
example of the same general class of ideas, and forced them into a
metaphorical union, by the medium of the generic definition. Thus
he says—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The Phœnix Pindar is a vast species alone.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>He means to say that he stands by himself: he is then ‘a vast species
alone:’ then by applying to this generality the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">principium individuationis</span></i>,
he becomes a Phœnix, because the Phœnix is the only
example of a species contained in an individual. Yet this is only a
literal or metaphysical coincidence: and literally and metaphysically
speaking, Pindar was not a species by himself, but only seemed so by
pre-eminence or excellence; that is, from qualities of mind appealing
to and absorbing the imagination, and which, therefore, ought to be
represented in poetical language, by some other obvious and palpable
image exhibiting the same kind or degree of excellence in other
things, as when Gray compares him to the Theban eagle,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Sailing with supreme dominion</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the azure deep of air.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Again, he talks in the Motto, or Invocation to his Muse, of
‘marching the Muse’s Hannibal’ into undiscovered regions. That
is, he thinks first of being a leader in poetry, and then he immediately,
by virtue of this abstraction, becomes a Hannibal; though
no two things can really be more unlike in all the associations belonging
to them, than a leader of armies and a leader of the tuneful
Nine. In like manner, he compares Bacon to Moses; for in <i>his</i>
verses extremes are sure to meet. The Hymn to Light, which
forms a perfect contrast to Milton’s Invocation to Light, in the
commencement of the third book of Paradise Lost, begins in the
following manner:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘First-born of Chaos, who so fair didst come</div>
      <div class='line in6'>From the old negro’s darksome womb!</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Which, when it saw the lovely child,</div>
      <div class='line'>The melancholy mass put on kind looks, and smil’d.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><hr /></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And soon after—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘’Tis, I believe, this archery to show</div>
      <div class='line in6'>That so much cost in colours thou,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>And skill in painting, dost bestow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Upon thy ancient arms, the gaudy heav’nly bow.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Swift as light thoughts their empty career run,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Thy race is finish’d when begun;</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Let a post-angel start with thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thou the goal of earth shalt reach as soon as he.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The conceits here are neither wit nor poetry; but a burlesque upon
both, made up of a singular metaphorical jargon, verbal generalities,
and physical analogies. Thus his calling Chaos, or Darkness, ‘the
old negro,’ would do for abuse or jest, but is too remote and
degrading for serious poetry, and yet it is meant for such. The
‘old negro’ is at best a nickname, and the smile on its face loses
its beauty in such company. The making out the rainbow to be a
species of heraldic painting, and converting an angel into a post-boy,
shew the same rage for comparison; but such comparisons are as
odious as they are unjust. Dr. Johnson has multiplied instances of
the same false style, in its various divisions and subdivisions.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Of
Cowley’s serious poems, the Complaint is the one I like the best;
and some of his translations in the Essays, as those on Liberty and
Retirement, are exceedingly good. The Odes to Vandyke, to the
Royal Society, to Hobbes, and to the latter Brutus, beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>‘Excellent Brutus,’ are all full of ingenious and high thoughts,
impaired by a load of ornament and quaint disguises. The Chronicle,
or list of his Mistresses, is the best of his original lighter pieces:
but the best of his poems are the translations from Anacreon, which
remain, and are likely to remain unrivalled. The spirit of wine
and joy circulates in them; and though they are lengthened out
beyond the originals, it is by fresh impulses of an eager and inexhaustible
feeling of delight. Here are some of them:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>DRINKING</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The thirsty earth soaks up the rain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And drinks, and gapes for drink again.</div>
      <div class='line'>The plants suck in the earth, and are</div>
      <div class='line'>With constant drinking fresh and fair.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sea itself, which one would think</div>
      <div class='line'>Should have but little need of drink,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drinks twice ten thousand rivers up,</div>
      <div class='line'>So fill’d that they o’erflow the cup.</div>
      <div class='line'>The busy sun (and one would guess</div>
      <div class='line'>By’s drunken fiery face no less)</div>
      <div class='line'>Drinks up the sea, and, when he ‘as done,</div>
      <div class='line'>The moon and stars drink up the sun.</div>
      <div class='line'>They drink and dance by their own light,</div>
      <div class='line'>They drink and revel all the night.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nothing in nature’s sober found,</div>
      <div class='line'>But an eternal health goes round.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fill up the bowl then, fill it high,</div>

      <div class='line'>Why, man of morals, tell me why?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This is a classical intoxication; and the poet’s imagination, giddy
with fancied joys, communicates its spirit and its motion to inanimate
things, and makes all nature reel round with it. It is not easy to
decide between these choice pieces, which may be reckoned among
the <i>delights of human kind</i>; but that to the Grasshopper is one of the
happiest as well as most serious:—</p>

<p class='c014'>Cowley’s Essays are among the most agreeable prose-compositions
in our language, being equally recommended by sense, wit, learning,
and interesting personal history, and written in a style quite free
from the faults of his poetry. It is a pity that he did not cultivate
his talent for prose more, and write less in verse, for he was
clearly a man of more reflection than imagination. The Essays on
Agriculture, on Liberty, on Solitude, and on Greatness, are all of
them delightful. From the last I may give his account of Senecio
as an addition to the instances of the ludicrous, which I have
attempted to enumerate in the introductory Lecture; whose ridiculous
affectation of grandeur Seneca the elder (he tells us) describes to
this effect: ‘Senecio was a man of a turbid and confused wit, who
could not endure to speak any but mighty words and sentences, till
this humour grew at last into so notorious a habit, or rather disease,
as became the sport of the whole town: he would have no servants,
but huge, massy fellows; no plate or household stuff, but thrice as
big as the fashion: you may believe me, for I speak it without raillery,
his extravagancy came at last into such a madness, that he would not
put on a pair of shoes, each of which was not big enough for both
his feet: he would eat nothing but what was great, nor touch any
fruit but horse-plums and pound-pears: he kept a mistress that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>a very giantess, and made her walk too always in chiopins, till, at
last, he got the surname of Senecio Grandio.’ This was certainly
the most absurd person we read of in antiquity. Cowley’s character
of Oliver Cromwell, which is intended as a satire, (though it
certainly produces a very different impression on the mind), may
vie for truth of outline and force of colouring with the masterpieces
of the Greek and Latin historians. It may serve as a contrast to
the last extract. ‘What can be more extraordinary, than that a
person of mean birth, no fortune, no eminent qualities of body, which
have sometimes, or of mind, which have often, raised men to
the highest dignities, should have the courage to attempt, and the
happiness to succeed in, so improbable a design, as the destruction
of one of the most ancient and most solidly-founded monarchies upon
the earth? That he should have the power or boldness to put his
prince and master to an open and infamous death; to banish that
numerous and strongly-allied family; to do all this under the name
and wages of a Parliament; to trample upon them too as he pleased,
and spurn them out of doors when he grew weary of them; to raise
up a new and unheard-of monster out of their ashes; to stifle that in
the very infancy, and set up himself above all things that ever were
called sovereign in England; to oppress all his enemies by arms, and
all his friends afterwards by artifice; to serve all parties patiently
for a while, and to command them victoriously at last; to over-run
each corner of the three nations, and overcome with equal facility
both the riches of the south and the poverty of the north; to be
feared and courted by all foreign princes, and adopted a brother to
the gods of the earth; to call together Parliaments with a word of
his pen, and scatter them again with the breath of his mouth; to be
humbly and daily petitioned that he would please to be hired, at the
rate of two millions a-year, to be the master of those who had hired
him before to be their servant; to have the estates and lives of
three kingdoms as much at his disposal, as was the little inheritance
of his father, and to be as noble and liberal in the spending of them;
and lastly, (for there is no end of all the particulars of his glory) to
bequeath all this with one word to his posterity; to die with peace
at home, and triumph abroad; to be buried among kings, and with
more than regal solemnity; and to leave a name behind him, not to
be extinguished, but with the whole world; which as it is now too
little for his praises, so might have been too for his conquests, if the
short line of his human life could have been stretched out to the
extent of his immortal designs!’</p>

<p class='c014'>Cowley has left one comedy, called Cutter of Coleman Street,
which met with an unfavourable reception at the time, and is now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>(not undeservedly) forgotten. It contains, however, one good scene,
which is rich both in fancy and humour, that between the puritanical
bride, Tabitha, and her ranting royalist husband. It is said that this
play was originally composed, and afterwards revived, as a satire
upon the Presbyterian party; yet it was resented by the court party
as a satire upon itself. A man must, indeed, be sufficiently blind
with party-prejudice, to have considered this as a compliment to his
own side of the question. ‘Call you this backing of your friends?’
The cavaliers are in this piece represented as reduced to the lowest
shifts in point of fortune, and sunk still lower in point of principle.</p>

<p class='c014'>The greatest single production of wit of this period, I might say
of this country, is Butler’s Hudibras. It contains specimens of
every variety of drollery and satire, and those specimens crowded
together into almost every page. The proof of this is, that nearly
one half of his lines are got by heart, and quoted for mottos. In
giving instances of different sorts of wit, or trying to recollect good
things of this kind, they are the first which stand ready in the
memory; and they are those which furnish the best tests and most
striking illustrations of what we want. Dr. Campbell, in his Philosophy
of Rhetoric, when treating of the subject of wit, which he has
done very neatly and sensibly, has constant recourse to two authors,
Pope and Butler, the one for ornament, the other more for use. Butler
is equally in the hands of the learned and the vulgar; for the sense is
generally as solid, as the images are amusing and grotesque. Whigs
and Tories join in his praise. He could not, in spite of himself,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>——‘narrow his mind,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘And to party give up what was meant for mankind.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Though his subject was local and temporary, his fame was not
circumscribed within his own age. He was admired by Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>
and has been rewarded by posterity. It is the poet’s fate! It is
not, perhaps, to be wondered at, that arbitrary and worthless
monarchs like Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span> should neglect those who pay court to
them. The idol (if it had sense) would despise its worshippers.
Indeed, Butler hardly merited any thing on the score of loyalty to
the house of Stuart. True wit is not a parasite plant. The strokes
which it aims at folly and knavery on one side of a question, tell
equally home on the other. Dr. Zachary Grey, who added notes
to the poem, and abused the leaders of Cromwell’s party by name,
would be more likely to have gained a pension for his services than
Butler, who was above such petty work. A poem like Hudibras
could not be <i>made to order of a court</i>. Charles might very well have
reproached the author with wanting to shew his own wit and sense
rather than to favour a tottering cause; and he has even been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>suspected, in parts of his poem, of glancing at majesty itself. He
in general ridicules not persons, but things, not a party, but their
principles, which may belong, as time and occasion serve, to one
set of solemn pretenders or another. This he has done most
effectually, in every possible way, and from every possible source,
learned or unlearned. He has exhausted the moods and figures of
satire and sophistry.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a> It would be possible to deduce the different
forms of syllogism in Aristotle, from the different violations or mock-imitations
of them in Butler. He fulfils every one of Barrow’s
conditions of wit, which I have enumerated in the first Lecture.
He makes you laugh or smile by comparing the high to the low,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
or by pretending to raise the low to the lofty;<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> he succeeds equally
in the familiarity of his illustrations,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> or their incredible extravagance,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
by comparing things that are alike or not alike. He surprises equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>by his coincidences or contradictions, by spinning out a long-winded
flimsy excuse, or by turning short upon you with the point-blank
truth. His rhymes are as witty as his reasons, equally remote from
what common custom would suggest;<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and he startles you sometimes
by an empty sound like a blow upon a drum-head,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> by a pun upon
one word,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> and by splitting another in two at the end of a verse,
with the same alertness and power over the odd and unaccountable
in the combinations of sounds as of images.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>There are as many shrewd aphorisms in his works, clenched by
as many quaint and individual allusions, as perhaps in any author
whatever. He makes none but palpable hits, that may be said to
give one’s understanding a rap on the knuckles.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> He is, indeed,
sometimes too prolific, and spins his antithetical sentences out, one
after another, till the reader, not the author, is wearied. He is,
however, very seldom guilty of repetitions or wordy paraphrases of
himself; but he sometimes comes rather too near it; and interrupts
the thread of his argument (for narrative he has none) by a tissue of
epigrams, and the tagging of points and conundrums without end.
The fault, or original sin of his genius, is, that from too much leaven
it ferments and runs over; and there is, unfortunately, nothing in his
subject to restrain and keep it within compass. He has no story
good for any thing; and his characters are good for very little.
They are too low and mechanical, or too much one thing, personifications,
as it were, of nicknames, and bugbears of popular prejudice
and vulgar cant, unredeemed by any virtue, or difference or variety
of disposition. There is no relaxation or shifting of the parts; and
the impression in some degree fails of its effect, and becomes
questionable from its being always the same. The satire looks, at
length, almost like special-pleading: it has nothing to confirm it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the apparent good humour or impartiality of the writer. It is something
revolting to see an author persecute his characters, the cherished
offspring of his brain, in this manner, without mercy. Hudibras and
Ralpho have immortalised Butler; and what has he done for them
in return, but set them up to be ‘pilloried on infamy’s high and
lasting stage?’ This is ungrateful!</p>

<p class='c014'>The rest of the characters have, in general, little more than their
names and professions to distinguish them. We scarcely know one
from another, Cerdon, or Orsin, or Crowdero, and are often obliged
to turn back, to connect their several adventures together. In fact,
Butler drives only at a set of obnoxious opinions, and runs into
general declamations. His poem in its essence is a satire, or didactic
poem. It is not virtually dramatic, or narrative. It is composed
of digressions by the author. He instantly breaks off in the middle
of a story, or incident, to comment upon and turn it into ridicule.
He does not give characters but topics, which would do just as well
in his own mouth without agents, or machinery of any kind. The
long digression in Part <span class='fss'>III.</span> in which no mention is made of the hero,
is just as good and as much an integrant part of the poem as the
rest. The conclusion is lame and impotent, but that is saying
nothing; the beginning and middle are equally so as to historical
merit. There is no keeping in his characters, as in Don Quixote;
nor any enjoyment of the ludicrousness of their situations, as in
Hogarth. Indeed, it requires a considerable degree of sympathy
to enter into and describe to the life even the ludicrous eccentricities
of others, and there is no appearance of sympathy or liking to his
subject in Butler. His humour is to his wit, ‘as one grain of wheat
in a bushel of chaff: you shall search all day, and when you find it,
it is not worth the trouble.’ Yet there are exceptions. The most
decisive is, I think, the description of the battle between Bruin and
his foes, Part <span class='fss'>I.</span> Canto iii., and again of the triumphal procession
in Part <span class='fss'>II.</span> Canto ii. of which the principal features are copied in
Hogarth’s election print, the Chairing of the successful candidate.
The account of Sidrophel and Whackum is another instance, and
there are some few others, but rarely sprinkled up and down.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>The widow, the termagant heroine of the poem, is still more disagreeable
than her lover; and her sarcastic account of the passion of
love, as consisting entirely in an attachment to land and houses, goods
and chattels, which is enforced with all the rhetoric the author is
master of, and hunted down through endless similes, is evidently
false. The vulgarity and meanness of sentiment which Butler
complains of in the Presbyterians, seems at last from long familiarity
and close contemplation to have tainted his own mind. Their
worst vices appear to have taken root in his imagination. Nothing
but what was selfish and groveling sunk into his memory, in the
depression of a menial situation under his supposed hero. He has,
indeed, carried his private grudge too far into his general speculations.
He even makes out the rebels to be cowards and well beaten, which
does not accord with the history of the times. In an excess of zeal
for church and state, he is too much disposed to treat religion as a
cheat, and liberty as a farce. It was the cant of that day (from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>which he is not free) to cry down sanctity and sobriety as marks of
disaffection, as it is the cant of this, to hold them up as proofs of
loyalty and staunch monarchical principles. Religion and morality
are, in either case, equally made subservient to the spirit of party,
and a stalking-horse to the love of power. Finally, there is a want
of pathos and humour, but no want of interest in Hudibras. It is
difficult to lay it down. One thought is inserted into another; the
links in the chain of reasoning are so closely rivetted, that the
attention seldom flags, but is kept alive (without any other assistance)
by the mere force of writing. There are occasional indications of
poetical fancy, and an eye for natural beauty; but these are kept
under or soon discarded, judiciously enough, but it should seem, not
for lack of power, for they are certainly as masterly as they are rare.
Such are the burlesque description of the stocks, or allegorical prison,
in which first Crowdero, and then Hudibras, is confined: the passage
beginning—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>As if he slept,’ &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

    </div>

<p class='c014'>Butler is sometimes scholastic, but he makes his learning tell to
good account; and for the purposes of burlesque, nothing can be
better fitted than the scholastic style.</p>

<p class='c017'>His ridicule of Milton’s Latin style is equally severe, but not so well
founded.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have only to add a few words respecting the dramatic writers
about this time, before we arrive at the golden period of our comedy.
Those of Etherege<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a> are good for nothing, except The Man of Mode,
or Sir Fopling Flutter, which is, I think, a more exquisite and airy
picture of the manners of that age than any other extant. Sir Fopling
himself is an inimitable coxcomb, but pleasant withal. He is a suit
of clothes personified. Dorimant (supposed to be Lord Rochester)
is the genius of grace, gallantry, and gaiety. The women in this
courtly play have very much the look and air (but something more
demure and significant) of Sir Peter Lely’s beauties. Harriet, the
mistress of Dorimant, who ‘tames his wild heart to her loving hand,’
is the flower of the piece. Her natural, untutored grace and spirit,
her meeting with Dorimant in the Park, bowing and mimicking him,
and the luxuriant description which is given of her fine person,
altogether form one of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvres</span></i> of dramatic painting. I
should think this comedy would bear reviving; and if Mr. Liston
were to play Sir Fopling, the part would shine out with double
lustre, ‘like the morn risen on mid-noon.’—Dryden’s comedies have
all the point that there is in ribaldry, and all the humour that there
is in extravagance. I am sorry I can say nothing better of them.
He was not at home in this kind of writing, of which he was
himself conscious. His play was <i>horse-play</i>. His wit (what there
is of it) is ingenious and scholar-like, rather than natural and dramatic.
Thus Burr, in the Wild Gallant, says to Failer, ‘She shall sooner
cut an atom than part us.’—His plots are pure <i>voluntaries</i> in absurdity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that bend and shift to his purpose without any previous notice or
reason, and are governed by final causes. Sir Martin Mar-all, which
was taken from the Duchess of Newcastle, is the best of his plays,
and the origin of the Busy Body. Otway’s comedies do no sort of
credit to him: on the contrary, they are as desperate as his fortunes.
The Duke of Buckingham’s famous Rehearsal, which has made, and
deservedly, so much noise in the world, is in a great measure taken
from Beaumont and Fletcher’s Knight of the Burning Pestle, which
was written in ridicule of the London apprentices in the reign of
Elizabeth, who had a great hand in the critical decisions of that age.
There were other dramatic writers of this period, noble and plebeian.
I shall only mention one other piece, the Committee, I believe by Sir
Robert Howard, which has of late been cut down into the farce
called Honest Thieves, and which I remember reading with a great
deal of pleasure many years ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>One cause of the difference between the immediate reception and
lasting success of dramatic works at this period may be, that after the
court took the play-houses under its particular protection, every thing
became very much an affair of private patronage. If an author could
get a learned lord or a countess-dowager to bespeak a box at his play,
and applaud the doubtful passages, he considered his business as done.
On the other hand, there was a reciprocity between men of letters
and their patrons; critics were ‘mitigated into courtiers, and submitted,’
as Mr. Burke has it, ‘to the soft collar of social esteem,’
in pronouncing sentence on the works of lords and ladies. How
ridiculous this seems now! What a hubbub it would create, if it
were known that a particular person of fashion and title had taken a
front-box in order to decide on the fate of a first play! How the
newspaper critics would laugh in their sleeves! How the public
would sneer! But at this time there was no public. I will not say,
therefore, that these times are better than those; but they are better,
I think, in this respect. An author now-a-days no longer hangs
dangling on the frown of a lord, or the smile of a lady of quality
(the one governed perhaps by his valet, and the other by her waiting-maid),
but throws himself boldly, making a lover’s leap of it, into
the broad lap of public opinion, on which he falls like a feather-bed;
and which, like the great bed of Ware, is wide enough to hold us all
very comfortably!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE IV<br /> <span class='c013'>ON WYCHERLEY, CONGREVE, VANBRUGH, AND FARQUHAR</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Comedy is a ‘graceful ornament to the civil order; the Corinthian
capital of polished society.’ Like the mirrors which have been
added to the sides of one of our theatres, it reflects the images of
grace, of gaiety, and pleasure double, and completes the perspective
of human life. To read a good comedy is to keep the best company
in the world, where the best things are said, and the most amusing
happen. The wittiest remarks are always ready on the tongue, and
the luckiest occasions are always at hand to give birth to the happiest
conceptions. Sense makes strange havoc of nonsense. Refinement
acts as a foil to affectation, and affectation to ignorance. Sentence
after sentence tells. We don’t know which to admire most, the
observation, or the answer to it. We would give our fingers to be
able to talk so ourselves, or to hear others talk so. In turning over
the pages of the best comedies, we are almost transported to another
world, and escape from this dull age to one that was all life, and
whim, and mirth, and humour. The curtain rises, and a gayer scene
presents itself, as on the canvass of Watteau. We are admitted
behind the scenes like spectators at court, on a levee or birth-day;
but it is the court, the gala day of wit and pleasure, of gallantry and
Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>! What an air breathes from the name! what a rustling
of silks and waving of plumes! what a sparkling of diamond earrings
and shoe-buckles! What bright eyes, (ah, those were Waller’s
Sacharissa’s as she passed!) what killing looks and graceful motions!
How the faces of the whole ring are dressed in smiles! how the
repartee goes round! how wit and folly, elegance and awkward
imitation of it, set one another off! Happy, thoughtless age, when
kings and nobles led purely ornamental lives; when the utmost
stretch of a morning’s study went no farther than the choice of a
sword-knot, or the adjustment of a side-curl; when the soul spoke
out in all the pleasing eloquence of dress; and beaux and belles,
enamoured of themselves in one another’s follies, fluttered like gilded
butterflies, in giddy mazes, through the walks of St. James’s Park!</p>

<p class='c014'>The four principal writers of this style of comedy (which I think
the best) are undoubtedly Wycherley, Congreve, Vanbrugh, and
Farquhar. The dawn was in Etherege, as its latest close was in
Sheridan.—It is hard to say which of these four is best, or in what
each of them excels, they had so many and such great excellences.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Congreve is the most distinct from the others, and the most easily
defined, both from what he possessed, and from what he wanted.
He had by far the most wit and elegance, with less of other things,
of humour, character, incident, &amp;c. His style is inimitable, nay
perfect. It is the highest model of comic dialogue. Every sentence
is replete with sense and satire, conveyed in the most polished and
pointed terms. Every page presents a shower of brilliant conceits,
is a tissue of epigrams in prose, is a new triumph of wit, a new
conquest over dulness. The fire of artful raillery is nowhere else so
well kept up. This style, which he was almost the first to introduce,
and which he carried to the utmost pitch of classical refinement,
reminds one exactly of Collins’s description of wit as opposed to
humour,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Whose jewels in his crisped hair</div>
      <div class='line'>Are placed each other’s light to share.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Sheridan will not bear a comparison with him in the regular
antithetical construction of his sentences, and in the mechanical
artifices of his style, though so much later, and though style in
general has been so much studied, and in the mechanical part so
much improved since then. It bears every mark of being what he
himself in the dedication of one of his plays tells us that it was, a
spirited copy taken off and carefully revised from the most select
society of his time, exhibiting all the sprightliness, ease, and animation
of familiar conversation, with the correctness and delicacy of
the most finished composition. His works are a singular treat to
those who have cultivated a taste for the niceties of English style:
there is a peculiar flavour in the very words, which is to be found
in hardly any other writer. To the mere reader his writings would
be an irreparable loss: to the stage they are already become a dead
letter, with the exception of one of them, Love for Love. This
play is as full of character, incident, and stage-effect, as almost any
of those of his contemporaries, and fuller of wit than any of his own,
except perhaps the Way of the World. It still acts, and is still
acted well. The effect of it is prodigious on the well-informed
spectator. In particular, Munden’s Foresight, if it is not just the
thing, is a wonderfully rich and powerful piece of comic acting.
His look is planet-struck; his dress and appearance like one of the
signs of the Zodiac taken down. Nothing can be more bewildered;
and it only wants a little more helplessness, a little more of the
doating querulous garrulity of age, to be all that one conceives of the
superannuated, star-gazing original. The gay, unconcerned opening
of this play, and the romantic generosity of the conclusion, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Valentine, when about to resign his mistress, declares—‘I never
valued fortune, but as it was subservient to my pleasure; and my
only pleasure was to please this lady,’—are alike admirable. The
peremptory bluntness and exaggerated descriptions of Sir Sampson
Legend are in a vein truly oriental, with a Shakespearian cast of
language, and form a striking contrast to the quaint credulity and
senseless superstitions of Foresight. The remonstrance of his son
to him, ‘to divest him, along with his inheritance, of his reason,
thoughts, passions, inclinations, affections, appetites, senses, and the
huge train of attendants which he brought into the world with him,’
with his valet’s accompanying comments, is one of the most eloquent
and spirited specimens of wit, pathos, and morality, that is to be
found. The short scene with Trapland, the money-broker, is of the
first water. What a picture is here drawn of Tattle! ‘More
misfortunes, Sir!’ says Jeremy. <i>Valentine.</i> ‘What, another dun?’
<i>Jeremy.</i> ‘No, Sir, but Mr. Tattle is come to wait upon you.’ What
an introduction to give of an honest gentleman in the shape of a
misfortune! The scenes between him, Miss Prue, and Ben, are
of a highly coloured description. Mrs. Frail and Mrs. Foresight
are ‘sisters every way;’ and the bodkin which Mrs. Foresight
brings as a proof of her sister’s levity of conduct, and which is so
convincingly turned against her as a demonstration of her own—‘Nay,
if you come to that, where did you find that bodkin?’—is one
of the trophies of the moral justice of the comic drama. The Old
Bachelor and Double Dealer are inferior to Love for Love, but one
is never tired of reading them. The fault of the last is, that Lady
Touchwood approaches, in the turbulent impetuosity of her character,
and measured tone of her declamation, too near to the tragedy-queen;
and that Maskwell’s plots puzzle the brain by their intricacy, as they
stagger our belief by their gratuitous villainy. Sir Paul and Lady
Pliant, and my Lord and Lady Froth, are also scarcely credible in
the extravagant insipidity and romantic vein of their follies, in
which they are notably seconded by the lively Mr. Brisk and ‘dying
Ned Careless.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The Way of the World was the author’s last and most carefully
finished performance. It is an essence almost too fine; and the
sense of pleasure evaporates in an aspiration after something that
seems too exquisite ever to have been realised. After inhaling the
spirit of Congreve’s wit, and tasting ‘love’s thrice reputed nectar’
in his works, the head grows giddy in turning from the highest
point of rapture to the ordinary business of life; and we can with
difficulty recal the truant Fancy to those objects which we are fain
to take up with here, <i>for better, for worse</i>. What can be more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>enchanting than Millamant and her morning thoughts, her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doux
sommeils</span></i>? What more provoking than her reproach to her lover,
who proposes to rise early, ‘Ah! idle creature!’ The meeting of
these two lovers after the abrupt dismissal of Sir Wilful, is the
height of careless and voluptuous elegance, as if they moved in air,
and drank a finer spirit of humanity.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Millamant.</i> Like Phœbus sung the no less amorous boy.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Mirabell.</i> Like Daphne she, as lovely and as coy.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Millamant is the perfect model of the accomplished fine lady:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Come, then, the colours and the ground prepare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air;</div>
      <div class='line'>Choose a firm cloud, before it falls, and in it</div>
      <div class='line'>Catch ere she change, the Cynthia of a minute.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>She is the ideal heroine of the comedy of high life, who arrives at
the height of indifference to every thing from the height of satisfaction;
to whom pleasure is as familiar as the air she draws; elegance
worn as a part of her dress; wit the habitual language which she
hears and speaks; love, a matter of course; and who has nothing
to hope or to fear, her own caprice being the only law to herself,
and rule to those about her. Her words seem composed of amorous
sighs—her looks are glanced at prostrate admirers or envious rivals.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘If there’s delight in love, ’tis when I see</div>
      <div class='line'>That heart that others bleed for, bleed for me.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>She refines on her pleasures to satiety; and is almost stifled in the
incense that is offered to her person, her wit, her beauty, and her
fortune. Secure of triumph, her slaves tremble at her frown: her
charms are so irresistible, that her conquests give her neither surprise
nor concern. ‘Beauty the lover’s gift?’ she exclaims, in answer to
Mirabell—‘Dear me, what is a lover that it can give? Why one
makes lovers as fast as one pleases, and they live as long as one
pleases, and they die as soon as one pleases; and then if one pleases,
one makes more.’ We are not sorry to see her tamed down at last,
from her pride of love and beauty, into a wife. She is good-natured
and generous, with all her temptations to the contrary; and her
behaviour to Mirabell reconciles us to her treatment of Witwoud and
Petulant, and of her country admirer, Sir Wilful.</p>

<p class='c014'>Congreve has described all this in his character of Millamant, but
he has done no more; and if he had, he would have done wrong.
He has given us the finest idea of an artificial character of this kind;
but it is still the reflection of an artificial character. The springs
of nature, passion, or imagination are but feebly touched. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>impressions appealed to, and with masterly address, are habitual,
external, and conventional advantages: the ideas of birth, of fortune,
of connexions, of dress, accomplishment, fashion, the opinion of the
world, of crowds of admirers, continually come into play, flatter our
vanity, bribe our interest, soothe our indolence, fall in with our
prejudices;—it is these that support the goddess of our idolatry,
with which she is every thing, and without which she would be
nothing. The mere fine lady of comedy, compared with the heroine
of romance or poetry, when stripped of her adventitious ornaments
and advantages, is too much like the doll stripped of its finery. In
thinking of Millamant, we think almost as much of her dress as of
her person: it is not so with respect to Rosalind or Perdita. The
poet has painted them differently; in colours which ‘nature’s own
sweet and cunning hand laid on,’ with health, with innocence, with
gaiety, ‘wild wit, invention ever new;’ with pure red and white,
like the wilding’s blossoms; with warbled wood-notes, like the
feathered choir’s; with thoughts fluttering on the wings of imagination,
and hearts panting and breathless with eager delight. The
interest we feel is in themselves; the admiration they excite is for
themselves. They do not depend upon the drapery of circumstances.
It is nature that ‘blazons herself’ in them. Imogen is the same in
a lonely cave as in a court; nay more, for she there seems something
heavenly—a spirit or a vision; and, as it were, shames her
destiny, brighter for the foil of circumstances. Millamant is nothing
but a fine lady; and all her airs and affectation would be blown
away with the first breath of misfortune. Enviable in drawing-rooms,
adorable at her toilette, fashion, like a witch, has thrown
its spell around her; but if that spell were broken, her power of
fascination would be gone. For that reason I think the character
better adapted for the stage: it is more artificial, more theatrical,
more meretricious. I would rather have seen Mrs. Abington’s
Millamant, than any Rosalind that ever appeared on the stage.
Some how, this sort of acquired elegance is more a thing of costume,
of air and manner; and in comedy, or on the comic stage, the light
and familiar, the trifling, superficial, and agreeable, bears, perhaps,
rightful sway over that which touches the affections, or exhausts the
fancy.—There is a callousness in the worst characters in the Way of
the World, in Fainall, and his wife and Mrs. Marwood, not very
pleasant; and a grossness in the absurd ones, such as Lady Wishfort
and Sir Wilful, which is not a little amusing. Witwoud wishes to
declaim, as far as he can, his relationship to this last character, and
says, ‘he’s but his half-brother;’ to which Mirabell makes answer—‘Then,
perhaps, he’s but half a fool.’ Peg is an admirable caricature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>of rustic awkwardness and simplicity, which is carried to excess
without any offence, from a sense of contrast to the refinement of
the chief characters in the play. The description of Lady Wishfort’s
face is a perfect piece of painting. The force of style in this
author at times amounts to poetry. Waitwell, who personates Sir
Rowland, and Foible, his accomplice in the matrimonial scheme
upon her mistress, hang as a dead weight upon the plot. They are
mere tools in the hands of Mirabell, and want life and interest.
Congreve’s characters can all of them speak well, they are mere
machines when they come to act. Our author’s superiority deserted
him almost entirely with his wit. His serious and tragic poetry is
frigid and jejune to an unaccountable degree. His <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> was the
description of actual manners, whether elegant or absurd; and when
he could not deride the one or embellish the other, his attempts at
romantic passion or imaginary enthusiasm are forced, abortive, and
ridiculous, or common-place. The description of the ruins of a
temple in the beginning of the Mourning Bride, was a great stretch
of his poetic genius. It has, however, been over-rated, particularly
by Dr. Johnson, who could have done nearly as well himself for a
single passage in the same style of moralising and sentimental description.
To justify this general censure, and to shew how the lightest
and most graceful wit degenerates into the heaviest and most bombastic
poetry, I will give one description out of his tragedy, which
will be enough. It is the speech which Gonsalez addresses to
Almeria:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Be every day of your long life like this.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sun, bright conquest, and your brighter eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Have all conspired to blaze promiscuous light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And bless this day with most unequal lustre.</div>
      <div class='line'>Your royal father, my victorious lord,</div>
      <div class='line'>Loaden with spoils, and ever-living laurel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is entering now, in martial pomp, the palace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Five hundred mules precede his solemn march,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which groan beneath the weight of Moorish wealth.</div>
      <div class='line'>Chariots of war, adorn’d with glittering gems,</div>
      <div class='line'>Succeed; and next, a hundred neighing steeds,</div>
      <div class='line'>White as the fleecy rain on Alpine hills;</div>
      <div class='line'>That bound, and foam, and champ the golden bit,</div>
      <div class='line'>As they disdain’d the victory they grace.</div>
      <div class='line'>Prisoners of war in shining fetters follow:</div>
      <div class='line'>And captains of the noblest blood of Afric</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweat by his chariot-wheels, and lick and grind,</div>
      <div class='line'>With gnashing teeth, the dust his triumphs raise.</div>
      <div class='line'>The swarming populace spread every wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cling, as if with claws they did enforce</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Their hold, through clifted stones stretching and staring</div>
      <div class='line'>As if they were all eyes, and every limb</div>
      <div class='line'>Would feed its faculty of admiration,</div>
      <div class='line'>While you alone retire, and shun this sight;</div>
      <div class='line'>This sight, which is indeed not seen (though twice</div>
      <div class='line'>The multitude should gaze) in absence of your eyes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This passage seems, in part, an imitation of Bolingbroke’s entry into
London. The style is as different from Shakspeare, as it is from
that of Witwoud and Petulant. It is plain that the imagination of
the author could not raise itself above the burlesque. His Mask of
Semele, Judgment of Paris, and other occasional poems, are even
worse. I would not advise any one to read them, or if I did, they
would not.</p>

<p class='c014'>Wycherley was before Congreve; and his Country Wife will last
longer than any thing of Congreve’s as a popular acting play. It is
only a pity that it is not entirely his own; but it is enough so to do
him never-ceasing honour, for the best things are his own. His
humour is, in general, broader, his characters more natural, and his
incidents more striking than Congreve’s. It may be said of Congreve,
that the workmanship overlays the materials: in Wycherley, the
casting of the parts and the fable are alone sufficient to ensure success.
We forget Congreve’s characters, and only remember what they say:
we remember Wycherley’s characters, and the incidents they meet
with, just as if they were real, and forget what they say, comparatively
speaking. Miss Peggy (or Mrs. Margery Pinchwife) is a
character that will last for ever, I should hope; and even when the
original is no more, if that should ever be, while self-will, curiosity,
art, and ignorance are to be found in the same person, it will be just
as good and as intelligible as ever in the description, because it is
built on first principles, and brought out in the fullest and broadest
manner. Agnes, in Moliere’s play, has a great deal of the same
unconscious impulse and heedless <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, but hers is sentimentalised
and varnished over (in the French fashion) with long-winded apologies
and analytical distinctions. It wants the same simple force and <i>home</i>
truth. It is not so direct and downright. Miss Peggy is not even a
novice in casuistry: she blurts out her meaning before she knows what
she is saying, and she speaks her mind by her actions oftener than by her
words. The outline of the plot is the same; but the point-blank hits
and master-strokes, the sudden thoughts and delightful expedients,
such as her changing the letters, the meeting her husband plump in
the Park, as she is running away from him as fast as her heels can
carry her, her being turned out of doors by her jealous booby of a
husband, and sent by him to her lover disguised as Alicia, her sisterin-law—occur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>first in the modern play. There are scarcely any
incidents or situations on the stage, which tell like these for pantomimic
effect, which give such a tingling to the blood, or so completely
take away the breath with expectation and surprise. Miss Prue, in
Love for Love, is a lively reflection of Miss Peggy, but without the
bottom and weight of metal. Hoyden is a match for her in constitution
and complete effect, as Corinna, in the Confederacy, is in
mischief, but without the wit. Mrs. Jordan used to play all these
characters; and as she played them, it was hard to know which was
best. Pinchwife, or Moody, (as he is at present called) is, like
others of Wycherley’s moral characters, too rustic, abrupt, and
cynical. He is a more disagreeable, but less tedious character than
the husband of Agnes, and both seem, by all accounts, to have been
rightly served. The character of Sparkish is quite new, and
admirably hit off. He is an exquisite and suffocating coxcomb; a
pretender to wit and letters, without common understanding, or the
use of his senses. The class of character is thoroughly exposed and
understood; but he persists in his absurd conduct so far, that it
becomes extravagant and disgusting, if not incredible, from mere
weakness and foppery. Yet there is something in him that we are
inclined to tolerate at first, as his professing that ‘with him a wit is
the first title to respect;’ and we regard his unwillingness to be
pushed out of the room, and coming back, in spite of their teeth, to
keep the company of wits and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raillers</span>, as a favourable omen. But he
utterly disgraces his pretensions before he has done. With all his
faults and absurdities, he is, however, a much less offensive character
than Tattle.—Horner is a stretch of probability in the first concoction
of that ambiguous character, (for he does not appear at present on the
stage as Wycherley made him) but notwithstanding the indecency
and indirectness of the means he employs to carry his plans into effect,
he deserves every sort of consideration and forgiveness, both for the
display of his own ingenuity, and the deep insight he discovers into
human nature—such as it was in the time of Wycherley. The
author has commented on this character, and the double meaning of
the name in his Plain Dealer, borrowing the remarks, and almost the
very words of Moliere, who has brought forward and defended his
own work against the objections of the precise part of his audience, in
his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Critique de l’Ecole des Femmes</span></cite>. There is no great harm in these
occasional plagiarisms, except that they make one uncomfortable at
other times, and distrustful of the originality of the whole.—The
Plain Dealer is Wycherley’s next best work; and is a most severe
and poignant moral satire. There is a heaviness about it, indeed, an
extravagance, an overdoing both in the style, the plot, and characters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>but the truth of feeling and the force of interest prevail over every
objection. The character of Manly, the Plain Dealer, is violent,
repulsive, and uncouth, which is a fault, though one that seems to have
been intended for the sake of contrast; for the portrait of consummate,
artful hypocrisy in Olivia, is, perhaps, rendered more striking
by it. The indignation excited against this odious and pernicious
quality by the masterly exposure to which it is here subjected, is ‘a
discipline of humanity.’ No one can read this play attentively
without being the better for it as long as he lives. It penetrates to
the core; it shews the immorality and hateful effects of duplicity, by
shewing it fixing its harpy fangs in the heart of an honest and worthy
man. It is worth ten volumes of sermons. The scenes between
Manly after his return, Olivia, Plausible, and Novel, are instructive
examples of unblushing impudence, of shallow pretensions to principle,
and of the most mortifying reflections on his own situation, and bitter
sense of female injustice and ingratitude, on the part of Manly. The
devil of hypocrisy and hardened assurance seems worked up to the
highest pitch of conceivable effrontery in Olivia, when, after confiding
to her cousin the story of her infamy, she, in a moment, turns round
upon her for some sudden purpose, and affecting not to know the
meaning of the other’s allusions to what she has just told her,
reproaches her with forging insinuations to the prejudice of her
character, and in violation of their friendship. ‘Go! you’re a
censorious ill woman.’ This is more trying to the patience than any
thing in the Tartuffe. The name of this heroine, and her overtures
to Fidelia, as the page, seem to have been suggested by Twelfth
Night. It is curious to see how the same subject is treated by two
such different authors as Shakspeare and Wycherley. The widow
Blackacre and her son are like her lawsuit—everlasting. A more
lively, palpable, bustling, ridiculous picture cannot be drawn. Jerry
is a hopeful lad, though undutiful and gets out of bad hands into worse.
Goldsmith evidently had an eye to these two precious characters, in
She Stoops to Conquer. Tony Lumpkin and his mother are of the
same family, and the incident of the theft of the casket of jewels,
and the bag of parchments, is nearly the same in both authors.
Wycherley’s other plays are not so good. The Gentleman Dancing
Master is a long, foolish farce, in the exaggerated manner of Moliere,
but without his spirit or whimsical invention. Love in a Wood,
though not what one would wish it to be for the author’s sake or our
own, is much better, and abounds in several rich and highly-coloured
scenes, particularly those in which Miss Lucy, her mother Crossbite,
Dapperwit, and Alderman Gripe are concerned. Some of the
subordinate characters and intrigues in this comedy are grievously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>spun out. Wycherley, when he got hold of a good thing, or sometimes
even of a bad one, was determined to make the most of it; and
might have said with Dogberry, truly enough, ‘Had I the tediousness
of a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all upon your
worships.’ In reading this author’s best works, those which one
reads most frequently over, and knows almost by heart, one cannot
help thinking of the treatment he received from Pope about his verses.
It was hardly excusable in a boy of sixteen to an old man of seventy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Vanbrugh comes next, and holds his own fully with the best. He
is no writer at all, as to mere authorship; but he makes up for it by
a prodigious fund of comic invention and ludicrous description,
bordering somewhat on caricature. Though he did not borrow from
him, he was much more like Moliere in genius than Wycherley was,
who professedly imitated him. He has none of Congreve’s graceful
refinement, and as little of Wycherley’s serious manner and studied
insight into the springs of character; but his exhibition of it in
dramatic contrast and unlooked-for situations, where the different
parties play upon one another’s failings, and into one another’s
hands, keeping up the jest like a game at battledore and shuttlecock,
and urging it to the utmost verge of breathless extravagance,
in the mere eagerness of the fray, is beyond that of any other of
our writers. His fable is not so profoundly laid, nor his characters
so well digested as Wycherley’s (who, in these respects, bore
some resemblance to Fielding). Vanbrugh does not lay the
same deliberate train from the outset to the conclusion, so that the
whole may hang together, and tend inevitably from the combination
of different agents and circumstances to the same decisive point:
but he works out scene after scene, on the spur of the occasion, and
from the immediate hold they take of his imagination at the moment,
without any previous bias or ultimate purpose, much more powerfully,
with more <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">verve</span></i>, and in a richer vein of original invention. His
fancy warms and burnishes out as if he were engaged in the real
scene of action, and felt all his faculties suddenly called forth to meet
the emergency. He has more nature than art: what he does best,
he does because he cannot help it. He has a masterly eye to the
advantages which certain accidental situations of character present to
him on the spot, and he executes the most difficult and rapid
theatrical movements at a moment’s warning. Of this kind are the
inimitable scenes in the Provoked Wife, between Razor and
Mademoiselle, where they repeat and act over again the rencontre in
the Mulberry-walk between Constant and his mistress, than which
nothing was ever more happily conceived, or done to more absolute
perfection; that again in the Relapse, where Loveless pushes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Berinthia into the closet; the sudden meeting in the Confederacy
between Dick and Mrs. Amlet; the altercation about the letter
between Flippanta and Corinna, in the same play, and that again
where Brass, at the house of Gripe the money-scrivener, threatens to
discover his friend and accomplice, and by talking louder and louder
to him, as he tries to evade his demands, extorts a grudging submission
from him. This last scene is as follows:—</p>

<p class='c024'>‘<i>Dick.</i> I wish my old hobbling mother han’t been blabbing something
here she should not do.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> Fear nothing, all’s safe on that side yet. But how speaks young
mistress’s epistle? soft and tender?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> As pen can write.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> So you think all goes well there?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> As my heart can wish.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> You are sure on’t?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Sure on’t!</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> Why then, ceremony aside—[<i>Putting on his hat</i>]—you and I
must have a little talk, Mr. Amlet.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Ah, Brass, what art thou going to do? wo’t ruin me?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> Look you, Dick, few words; you are in a smooth way of making
your fortune; I hope all will roll on. But how do you intend matters

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Death and furies! What a time does take to talk on’t?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> Good words, or I betray you; they have already heard of one
Mr. Amlet in the house.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Here’s a son of a whore.       [<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> In short, look smooth, and be a good prince. I am your valet,
’tis true: your footman, sometimes, which I’m enraged at; but you have
always had the ascendant I confess: when we were schoolfellows, you
made me carry your books, make your exercise, own your rogueries, and
sometimes take a whipping for you. When we were fellow-’prentices,
though I was your senior, you made me open the shop, clean my master’s
shoes, cut last at dinner, and eat all the crust. In our sins too, I must
own you still kept me under; you soar’d up to adultery with the mistress,
while I was at humble fornication with the maid. Nay, in our punishments
you still made good your post; for when once upon a time I was
sentenced but to be whipp’d, I cannot deny but you were condemn’d to be
hang’d. So that in all times, I must confess, your inclinations have been
greater and nobler than mine; however, I cannot consent that you should
at once fix fortune for life, and I dwell in my humilities for the rest of my
days.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Hark thee, Brass, if I do not most nobly by thee, I’m a dog.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> And when?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> As soon as ever I am married.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> Ay, the plague take thee.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Then you mistrust me?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> I do, by my faith. Look you, Sir, some folks we mistrust,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>because we don’t know them: others we mistrust, because we do know
them: and for one of these reasons I desire there may be a bargain
beforehand: if not [<i>raising his voice</i>] look ye, Dick Amlet—</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Dick.</i> Soft, my dear friend and companion. The dog will ruin me
[<i>Aside</i>]. Say, what is’t will content thee?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Brass.</i> You know you gave me a bank-bill this morning to receive for

<div class='c019'>[<i>Takes off his hat.</i></div>

<p class='c009'>The Confederacy is a comedy of infinite contrivance and intrigue,
with a matchless spirit of impudence. It is a fine careless <i>exposé</i> of
heartless want of principle: for there is no anger or severity against
vice expressed in it, as in Wycherley. The author’s morality in all
cases (except his Provoked Wife, which was undertaken as a penance
for past peccadillos) sits very loose upon him. It is a little upon the
turn; ‘it does somewhat smack.’ Old Palmer, as Dick Amlet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>asking his mother’s blessing on his knee, was the very idea of a
graceless son.—His sweetheart Corinna is a Miss Prue, but nature
works in her more powerfully.—Lord Foppington, in the Relapse, is
a most splendid caricature: he is a personification of the foppery and
folly of dress and external appearance in full feather. He blazes out
and dazzles sober reason with ridiculous ostentation. Still I think
this character is a copy from Etherege’s Sir Fopling Flutter, and
upon the whole, perhaps, Sir Fopling is the more natural grotesque
of the two. His soul is more in his dress; he is a more disinterested
coxcomb. The lord is an ostentatious, strutting, vain-glorious
blockhead: the knight is an unaffected, self-complacent, serious
admirer of his equipage and person. For instance, what they
severally say on the subject of contemplating themselves in the glass,
is a proof of this. Sir Fopling thinks a looking-glass in the room
‘the best company in the world;’ it is another self to him: Lord
Foppington merely considers it as necessary to adjust his appearance,
that he may make a figure in company. The finery of the one has
an imposing air of grandeur about it, and is studied for effect: the
other is really in love with a laced suit, and is hand and glove with
the newest-cut fashion. He really thinks his tailor or peruke-maker
the greatest man in the world, while his lordship treats them familiarly
as necessary appendages of his person. Still this coxcomb-nobleman’s
effeminacy and mock-heroic vanity are admirably depicted, and
held up to unrivalled ridicule; and his courtship of Miss Hoyden is
excellent in all its stages, and ends oracularly.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Lord Foppington.</i>—‘Now, for my part, I think the wisest thing a
man can do with an aching heart, is to put on a serene countenance;
for a philosophical air is the most becoming thing in the world to the
face of a person of quality: I will therefore bear my disgrace like a
great man, and let the people see I am above an affront. [<i>then turning
to his brother</i>] Dear Tam, since things are thus fallen out, pr’ythee
give me leave to wish thee joy, I do it <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de bon cœur</span></i>, strike me dumb:
you have married a woman beautiful in her person, charming in her
airs, prudent in her conduct, constant in her inclinations, and of a
nice morality—stap my vitals!’</p>

<p class='c014'>Poor Hoyden fares ill in his lordship’s description of her, though
she could expect no better at his hands for her desertion of him.
She wants sentiment, to be sure, but she has other qualifications—she
is a fine bouncing piece of flesh and blood. Her first announcement
is decisive—‘Let loose the greyhound, and lock up Hoyden.’ Her
declaration, ‘It’s well they’ve got me a husband, or ecod, I’d marry
the baker,’ comes from her mouth like a shot from a culverin, and
leaves no doubt, by its effect upon the ear, that she would have made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>it good in the sequel, if she had not been provided for. Her
indifference to the man she is to marry, and her attachment to the
finery and the title, are justified by an attentive observation of nature
in its simplest guise. There is, however, no harm in Hoyden; she
merely wishes to consult her own inclination: she is by no means
like Corinna in the Confederacy, ‘a devilish girl at the bottom,’ nor
is it her great delight to plague other people.—Sir Tunbelly Clumsy
is the right worshipful and worthy father of so delicate an offspring.
He is a coarse, substantial contrast to the flippant and flimsy Lord
Foppington. If the one is not without reason ‘proud to be at the
head of so prevailing a party’ as that of coxcombs, the other may
look big and console himself (under some affronts) with being a very
competent representative, a knight of the shire, of the once formidable,
though now obsolete class of country squires, who had no idea
beyond the boundaries of their own estates, or the circumference of
their own persons. His unwieldy dulness gives, by the rule of
contraries, a lively sense of lightness and grace: his stupidity answers
all the purposes of wit. His portly paunch repels a jest like a woolsack:
a sarcasm rebounds from him like a ball. His presence is a
cure for gravity; and he is a standing satire upon himself and the
class in natural history to which he belonged.—Sir John Brute, in
the Provoked Wife, is an animal of the same English growth, but of
a cross-grained breed. He has a spice of the demon mixed up with
the brute; is mischievous as well as stupid; has improved his natural
parts by a town education and example; opposes the fine-lady airs
and graces of his wife by brawling oaths, impenetrable surliness, and
pot-house valour; overpowers any tendency she might have to
vapours or hysterics, by the fumes of tobacco and strong beer; and
thinks to be master in his own house by roaring in taverns, reeling
home drunk every night, breaking lamps, and beating the watch.
He does not, however, find this lordly method answer. He turns
out to be a coward as well as a bully, and dares not resent the
injuries he has provoked by his unmanly behaviour. This was
Garrick’s favourite part; and I have heard that his acting in the
drunken scene, in which he was disguised not as a clergyman, but as
a woman of the town, which was an alteration of his own to suit the
delicacy of the times, was irresistible. The ironical conversations in
this play between Belinda and Lady Brute, as well as those in the
Relapse between Amanda and her cousin Berinthia, will do to compare
with Congreve in the way of wit and studied raillery, but they
will not stand the comparison. Araminta and Clarissa keep up the
ball between them with more spirit, for their conversation is very like
that of kept-mistresses; and the mixture of fashionable <i>slang</i> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>professed want of principle gives a sort of zest and high seasoning to
their confidential communications, which Vanbrugh could supply as
well as any body. But he could not do without the taint of
grossness and licentiousness. Lady Townly is not the really vicious
character, nor quite the fine lady, which the author would have her to
be. Lady Grace is so far better; she is what she pretends to be,
merely <i>sober</i> and insipid.—Vanbrugh’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> was not the sentimental
or didactic; his genius flags and grows dull when it is not put into
action, and wants the stimulus of sudden emergency, or the fortuitous
collision of different motives, to call out all its force and vivacity.
His antitheses are happy and brilliant contrasts of character; his
<i>double entendres</i> equivocal situations; his best jokes are practical
devices, not epigrammatic conceits. His wit is that which is
emphatically called <i>mother-wit</i>. It brings those who possess it, or to
whom he lends it, into scrapes by its restlessness, and brings them out
of them by its alacrity. Several of his favourite characters are
knavish, adroit adventurers, who have all the gipsy jargon, the
cunning impudence, cool presence of mind, selfishness, and indefatigable
industry; all the excuses, lying, dexterity, the intellectual
juggling and legerdemain tricks, necessary to fit them for this sort of
predatory warfare on the simplicity, follies, or vices of mankind.
He discovers the utmost dramatic generalship in bringing off his
characters at a pinch, and by an instantaneous <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ruse de guerre</span></i>, when
the case seems hopeless in any other hands. The train of his
associations, to express the same thing in metaphysical language, lies
in following the suggestions of his fancy into every possible connexion
of cause and effect, rather than into every possible combination of
likeness or difference. His ablest characters shew that they are so
by displaying their ingenuity, address, and presence of mind in
critical junctures, and in their own affairs, rather than their wisdom
or their wit ‘in intellectual gladiatorship,’ or in speculating on the
affairs and characters of other people.</p>

<p class='c014'>Farquhar’s chief characters are also adventurers; but they are
adventurers of a romantic, not a knavish stamp, and succeed no less
by their honesty than their boldness. They conquer their difficulties,
and effect their ‘hair-breadth ‘scapes’ by the impulse of natural
enthusiasm and the confidence of high principles of gallantry and
honour, as much as by their dexterity and readiness at expedients.
They are real gentlemen, and only pretended impostors. Vanbrugh’s
upstart heroes are without ‘any relish of salvation,’ without generosity,
virtue, or any pretensions to it. We have little sympathy for them,
and no respect at all. But we have every sort of good-will towards
Farquhar’s heroes, who have as many peccadillos to answer for, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>play as many rogue’s tricks, but are honest fellows at bottom.
I know little other difference between these two capital writers and
copyists of nature, than that Farquhar’s nature is the better nature of
the two. We seem to like both the author and his favourites. He
has humour, character, and invention, in common with the other,
with a more unaffected gaiety and spirit of enjoyment, which overflows
and sparkles in all he does. He makes us laugh from pleasure
oftener than from malice. He somewhere prides himself in having
introduced on the stage the class of comic heroes here spoken of,
which has since become a standard character, and which represents
the warm-hearted, rattle-brained, thoughtless, high-spirited young
fellow, who floats on the back of his misfortunes without repining,
who forfeits appearances, but saves his honour—and he gives us to
understand that it was his own. He did not need to be ashamed of
it. Indeed there is internal evidence that this sort of character is his
own, for it pervades his works generally, and is the moving spirit that
informs them. His comedies have on this account probably a greater
appearance of truth and nature than almost any others. His incidents
succeed one another with rapidity, but without premeditation; his
wit is easy and spontaneous; his style animated, unembarrassed, and
flowing; his characters full of life and spirit, and never overstrained
so as to ‘o’erstep the modesty of nature,’ though they sometimes,
from haste and carelessness, seem left in a crude, unfinished state.
There is a constant ebullition of gay, laughing invention, cordial good
humour, and fine animal spirits, in his writings.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the four writers here classed together, we should perhaps have
courted Congreve’s acquaintance most, for his wit and the elegance of
his manners; Wycherley’s, for his sense and observation on human
nature; Vanbrugh’s, for his power of farcical description and telling
a story; Farquhar’s, for the pleasure of his society, and the love of
good fellowship. His fine gentlemen are not gentlemen of fortune
and fashion, like those in Congreve; but are rather ‘God Almighty’s
gentlemen.’ His valets are good fellows: even his chambermaids
are some of them disinterested and sincere. But his fine ladies, it
must be allowed, are not so amiable, so witty, or accomplished, as
those in Congreve. Perhaps they both described women in high-life
as they found them: Congreve took their conversation, Farquhar
their conduct. In the way of fashionable vice and petrifying affectation,
there is nothing to come up to his Lady Lurewell, in the Trip
to the Jubilee. She by no means makes good Mr. Burke’s courtly
and chivalrous observation, that the evil of vice consists principally in
its want of refinement; and one benefit of the dramatic exhibition of
such characters is, that they overturn false maxims of morality, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>settle accounts fairly and satisfactorily between theory and practice.
Her lover, Colonel Standard, is indeed an awkward incumbrance
upon so fine a lady: it was a character that the poet did not like;
and he has merely sketched him in, leaving him to answer for himself
as well as he could, which is but badly. We have no suspicion,
either from his conduct, or from any hint dropped by accident, that
he is the first seducer and the possessor of the virgin affections of
Lady Lurewell. The double transformation of this virago from vice
to virtue, and from virtue to vice again, her plausible pretensions and
artful wiles, her violent temper and dissolute passions, shew a thorough
knowledge of the effects both of nature and habit in making up human
character. Farquhar’s own heedless turn for gallantry would be
likely to throw him upon such a character; and his goodness of heart
and sincerity of disposition would teach him to expose its wanton
duplicity and gilded rottenness. Lurewell is almost as abandoned a
character as Olivia, in the Plain Dealer; but the indignation excited
against her is of a less serious and tragic cast. Her peevish disgust
and affected horror at every thing that comes near her, form a very
edifying picture. Her dissatisfaction and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> are not mere airs and
graces worn for fashion’s sake; but are real and tormenting inmates
of her breast, arising from a surfeit of pleasure and the consciousness
of guilt. All that is hateful in the caprice, ill humour, spite, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hauteur</span></i>,
folly, impudence, and affectation of the complete woman of quality, is
contained in the scene between her and her servants in the first act.
The depravity would be intolerable, even in imagination, if the
weakness were not ludicrous in the extreme. It shews, in the
highest degree, the power of circumstances and example to pervert
the understanding, the imagination, and even the senses. The manner
in which the character of the gay, wild, free-hearted, but not altogether
profligate or unfeeling Sir Harry Wildair is played off against the
designing, vindictive, imperious, uncontroulable, and unreasonable
humours of Lurewell, in the scene where she tries to convince him
of his wife’s infidelity, while he stops his ears to her pretended
proofs, is not surpassed in modern comedy. I shall give it here:—</p>

<p class='c024'>‘<i>Wildair.</i> Now, dear madam, I have secur’d my brother, you have
dispos’d of the colonel, and we’ll rail at love till we ha’n’t a word more
to say.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lurewell.</i> Ay, Sir Harry. Please to sit a little, Sir. You must know
I’m in a strange humour of asking you some questions. How did you
like your lady, pray, Sir?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Like her! Ha, ha, ha. So very well, faith, that for her very sake
I’m in love with every woman I meet.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> And did matrimony please you extremely?</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span><i>Wild.</i> So very much, that if polygamy were allow’d, I would have a new
wife every day.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Oh, Sir Harry! this is raillery. But your serious thoughts upon
the matter, pray.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Why, then, Madam, to give you my true sentiments of wedlock:
I had a lady that I married by chance, she was virtuous by chance, and I
lov’d her by great chance. Nature gave her beauty, education an air; and
fortune threw a young fellow of five-and-twenty in her lap. I courted her
all day, lov’d her all night; she was my mistress one day, and my wife
another: I found in one the variety of a thousand, and the very confinement
of marriage gave me the pleasure of change.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> And she was very virtuous.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Look ye, Madam, you know she was beautiful. She had good
nature about her mouth, the smile of beauty in her cheeks, sparkling wit
in her forehead, and sprightly love in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Pshaw! I knew her very well; the woman was well enough.
But you don’t answer my question, Sir.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> So, Madam, as I told you before, she was young and beautiful,
I was rich and vigorous; my estate gave a lustre to my love, and a swing
to our enjoyment; round, like the ring that made us one, our golden
pleasures circled without end.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Golden pleasures! Golden fiddlesticks. What d’ye tell me of
your canting stuff? Was she virtuous, I say?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Ready to burst with envy; but I will torment thee a little.
[<i>Aside.</i>] So, Madam, I powder’d to please her, she dress’d to engage me;
we toy’d away the morning in amorous nonsense, loll’d away the evening
in the Park or the playhouse, and all the night—hem!</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Look ye, Sir, answer my question, or I shall take it ill.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Then, Madam, there was never such a pattern of unity. Her
wants were still prevented by my supplies; my own heart whisper’d me
her desires, ‘cause she herself was there; no contention ever rose, but the
dear strife of who should most oblige: no noise about authority; for
neither would stoop to command, ‘cause both thought it glory to obey.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Stuff! stuff! stuff! I won’t believe a word on’t.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Ha, ha, ha. Then, Madam, we never felt the yoke of matrimony,
because our inclinations made us one; a power superior to the forms of
wedlock. The marriage torch had lost its weaker light in the bright flame
of mutual love that join’d our hearts before; then—</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Hold, hold, Sir; I cannot bear it; Sir Harry, I’m affronted.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Ha, ha, ha. Affronted!</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Yes, Sir; ’tis an affront to any woman to hear another commended;
and I will resent it.—In short, Sir Harry, your wife was a—</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Buz, Madam—no detraction! I’ll tell you what she was. So
much an angel in her conduct, that though I saw another in her arms,
I should have thought the devil had rais’d the phantom, and my more
conscious reason had given my eyes the lie.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Very well! Then I a’n’t to be believ’d, it seems. But, d’ye
hear, Sir?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Nay, Madam, do you hear! I tell you, ’tis not in the power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>malice to cast a blot upon her fame; and though the vanity of our sex, and
the envy of yours, conspir’d both against her honour, I would not hear a
syllable.</p>

<div class='c019'>[<i>Stopping his ears.</i></div>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Why then, as I hope to breathe, you shall hear it. The picture!
the picture! the picture!</p>

<div class='c019'>[<i>Bawling aloud.</i></div>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Ran, tan, tan. A pistol-bullet from ear to ear.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> That picture which you had just now from the French marquis
for a thousand pound; that very picture did your very virtuous wife send
to the marquis as a pledge of her very virtuous and dying affection. So
that you are both robb’d of your honour, and cheated of your money.</p>

<div class='c019'>[<i>Aloud.</i></div>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Louder, louder, Madam.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> I tell you, Sir, your wife was a jilt; I know it, I’ll swear it.
She virtuous! she was a devil!</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> [<i>Sings.</i>] Tal, al, deral.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Was ever the like seen! He won’t hear me. I burst with malice,
and now he won’t mind me! Won’t you hear me yet?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> No, no, Madam.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Nay, then I can’t bear it. [<i>Bursts out a crying.</i>] Sir, I must say
that you’re an unworthy person, to use a woman of quality at this rate,
when she has her heart full of malice; I don’t know but it may make me
miscarry. Sir, I say again and again, that she was no better than one of
us, and I know it; I have seen it with my eyes, so I have.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Good heav’ns deliver me, I beseech thee. How shall I ’scape!</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Will you hear me yet? Dear Sir Harry, do but hear me; I’m
longing to speak.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Oh! I have it.—Hush, hush, hush.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Eh! what’s the matter?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> A mouse! a mouse! a mouse!</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Lure.</i> Where? where? where?</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Wild.</i> Your petticoats, your petticoats, Madam. [<i>Lurewell shrieks and
runs.</i>] O my head! I was never worsted by a woman before. But I have
heard so much to know the marquis to be a villain. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Nay,
then, I must run for’t. [<i>Runs out, and returns.</i>] The entry is stopt by a
chair coming in; and something there is in that chair that I will discover,
if I can find a place to hide myself. [<i>Goes to the closet door.</i>] Fast! I have
keys about me for most locks about St. James’s. Let me see. [<i>Tries one
key.</i>] No, no; this opens my Lady Planthorn’s back-door. [<i>Tries another.</i>]
Nor this; this is the key to my Lady Stakeall’s garden. [<i>Tries a third.</i>]
Ay, ay, this does it, faith. [<i>Goes into the closet.</i>]’</p>

<p class='c009'>The dialogue between Cherry and Archer, in the Beaux’ Stratagem,
in which she repeats her well-conned love catechism, is as good as
this, but not so fit to be repeated any where but on the stage. The
Beaux’ Stratagem is the best of his plays, as a whole; infinitely
lively, bustling, and full of point and interest. The assumed disguise
of the two principal characters, Archer and Aimwell, is a perpetual
amusement to the mind. Scrub is an indispensable appendage to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>country gentleman’s kitchen, and an exquisite confidant for the secrets
of young ladies. The Recruiting Officer is not one of Farquhar’s
best comedies, though it is light and entertaining. It contains chiefly
sketches and hints of characters; and the conclusion of the plot is
rather lame. He informs us, in the dedication to the published play,
that it was founded on some local and personal circumstances that
happened in Shropshire, where he was himself a recruiting officer;
and it seems not unlikely, that most of the scenes actually took place
at the foot of the Wrekin. The Inconstant is much superior to it.
The romantic interest and impressive catastrophe of this play I thought
had been borrowed from the more poetical and tragedy-practised muse
of Beaumont and Fletcher; but I find they are taken from an actual
circumstance which took place in the author’s knowledge, at Paris.
His other pieces, Love and a Bottle, and the Twin Rivals, are not
on a par with these; and are no longer in possession of the stage.
The public are, after all, not the worst judges.—Farquhar’s Letters,
prefixed to the collection of his plays, are lively, good humoured, and
sensible; and contain, among other things, an admirable exposition of
the futility of the dramatic unities of time and place. This criticism
preceded Dennis’s remarks on that subject, in his Strictures on
Mr. Addison’s Cato; and completely anticipates all that Dr.
Johnson has urged so unanswerably on the subject, in his preface to
Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c014'>We may date the decline of English comedy from the time of
Farquhar. For this several causes might be assigned in the political
and moral changes of the times; but among other minor ones, Jeremy
Collier, in his View of the English Stage, frightened the poets, and
did all he could to spoil the stage, by pretending to reform it; that
is, by making it an echo of the pulpit, instead of a reflection of the
manners of the world. He complains bitterly of the profaneness of
the stage; and is for fining the actors for every oath they utter, to
put an end to the practice; as if common swearing had been an
invention of the poets and stage-players. He cannot endure that the
fine gentlemen drink, and the fine ladies intrigue, in the scenes of
Congreve and Wycherley, when things so contrary to law and gospel
happened nowhere else. He is vehement against duelling, as a
barbarous custom, of which the example is suffered with impunity
nowhere but on the stage. He is shocked at the number of fortunes
that are irreparably ruined by the vice of gaming on the boards of the
theatres. He seems to think that every breach of the ten commandments
begins and ends there. He complains that the tame husbands
of his time are laughed at on the stage, and that the successful
gallants triumph, which was without precedent either in the city or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the court. He does not think it enough that the stage ‘shews vice
its own image, scorn its own feature,’ unless they are damned at the
same instant, and carried off (like Don Juan) by real devils to the
infernal regions, before the faces of the spectators. It seems that the
author would have been contented to be present at a comedy or a
farce, like a Father Inquisitor, if there was to be an <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">auto da fé</span></i> at the
end, to burn both the actors and the poet. This sour, nonjuring
critic has a great horror and repugnance at poor human nature, in
nearly all its shapes; of the existence of which he appears only to
be aware through the stage: and this he considers as the only
exception to the practice of piety, and the performance of the whole
duty of man; and seems fully convinced, that if this nuisance were
abated, the whole world would be regulated according to the creed
and the catechism.—This is a strange blindness and infatuation!
He forgets, in his overheated zeal, two things: First, That the stage
must be copied from real life, that the manners represented there
must exist elsewhere, and ‘denote a foregone conclusion,’ to satisfy
common sense.—Secondly, That the stage cannot shock common
decency, according to the notions that prevail of it in any age or
country, because the exhibition is public. If the pulpit, for instance,
had banished all vice and imperfection from the world, as our critic
would suppose, we should not have seen the offensive reflection of
them on the stage, which he resents as an affront to the cloth, and an
outrage on religion. On the contrary, with such a sweeping reformation
as this theory implies, the office of the preacher, as well as of the
player, would be gone; and if the common peccadillos of lying,
swearing, intriguing, fighting, drinking, gaming, and other such
obnoxious dramatic common-places, were once fairly got rid of in
reality, neither the comic poet would be able to laugh at them on
the stage, nor our good-natured author to consign them over to
damnation elsewhere. The work is, however, written with ability,
and did much mischief: it produced those <i>do-me-good</i>, lack-a-daisical,
whining, make-believe comedies in the next age, (such as
Steele’s Conscious Lovers, and others,) which are enough to set
one to sleep, and where the author tries in vain to be merry and
wise in the same breath; in which the utmost stretch of licentiousness
goes no farther than the gallant’s being suspected of keeping a
mistress, and the highest proof of courage is given in his refusing to
accept a challenge.</p>

<p class='c014'>In looking into the old editions of the comedies of the last age,
I find the names of the best actors of those times, of whom scarcely
any record is left but in Colley Cibber’s Life, and the monument to
Mrs. Oldfield, in Westminster Abbey; which Voltaire reckons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>among the proofs of the liberality, wisdom, and politeness of the

<p class='c014'>I now come to speak of that sort of writing which has been so
successfully cultivated in this country by our periodical Essayists, and
which consists in applying the talents and resources of the mind to
all that mixed mass of human affairs, which, though not included
under the head of any regular art, science, or profession, falls under
the cognizance of the writer, and ‘comes home to the business and
bosoms of men.’ <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quicquid agunt homines nostri farrago libelli</span></i>, is the
general motto of this department of literature. It does not treat of
minerals or fossils, of the virtues of plants, or the influence of planets;
it does not meddle with forms of belief, or systems of philosophy, nor
launch into the world of spiritual existences; but it makes familiar
with the world of men and women, records their actions, assigns
their motives, exhibits their whims, characterises their pursuits in
all their singular and endless variety, ridicules their absurdities,
exposes their inconsistencies, ‘holds the mirror up to nature, and
shews the very age and body of the time its form and pressure;’
takes minutes of our dress, air, looks, words, thoughts, and actions;
shews us what we are, and what we are not; plays the whole game
of human life over before us, and by making us enlightened spectators
of its many-coloured scenes, enables us (if possible) to become
tolerably reasonable agents in the one in which we have to perform
a part. ‘The act and practic part of life is thus made the mistress
of our theorique.’ It is the best and most natural course of study.
It is in morals and manners what the experimental is in natural
philosophy, as opposed to the dogmatical method. It does not deal
in sweeping clauses of proscription and anathema, but in nice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>distinctions and liberal constructions. It makes up its general
accounts from details, its few theories from many facts. It does
not try to prove all black or all white as it wishes, but lays on the
intermediate colours, (and most of them not unpleasing ones,) as it
finds them blended with ‘the web of our life, which is of a mingled
yarn, good and ill together.’ It inquires what human life is and has
been, to shew what it ought to be. It follows it into courts and
camps, into town and country, into rustic sports or learned disputations,
into the various shades of prejudice or ignorance, of refinement
or barbarism, into its private haunts or public pageants, into its
weaknesses and littlenesses, its professions and its practices—before
it pretends to distinguish right from wrong, or one thing from
another. How, indeed, should it do so otherwise?</p>

<p class='c017'>The writers I speak of are, if not moral philosophers, moral historians,
and that’s better: or if they are both, they found the one character
upon the other; their premises precede their conclusions; and we
put faith in their testimony, for we know that it is true.</p>

<p class='c014'>Montaigne was the first person who in his Essays led the way
to this kind of writing among the moderns. The great merit of
Montaigne then was, that he may be said to have been the first who
had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. And
as courage is generally the effect of conscious strength, he was
probably led to do so by the richness, truth, and force of his own
observations on books and men. He was, in the truest sense, a
man of original mind, that is, he had the power of looking at things
for himself, or as they really were, instead of blindly trusting to,
and fondly repeating what others told him that they were. He got
rid of the go-cart of prejudice and affectation, with the learned
lumber that follows at their heels, because he could do without
them. In taking up his pen he did not set up for a philosopher,
wit, orator, or moralist, but he became all these by merely daring
to tell us whatever passed through his mind, in its naked simplicity
and force, that he thought any ways worth communicating. He
did not, in the abstract character of an author, undertake to say all
that could be said upon a subject, but what in his capacity as an
inquirer after truth he happened to know about it. He was neither
a pedant nor a bigot. He neither supposed that he was bound to
know all things, nor that all things were bound to conform to what
he had fancied or would have them to be. In treating of men and
manners, he spoke of them as he found them, not according to preconceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>notions and abstract dogmas; and he began by teaching
us what he himself was. In criticising books he did not compare
them with rules and systems, but told us what he saw to like or
dislike in them. He did not take his standard of excellence
‘according to an exact scale’ of Aristotle, or fall out with a work
that was good for any thing, because ‘not one of the angles at the
four corners was a right one.’ He was, in a word, the first author
who was not a book-maker, and who wrote not to make converts
of others to established creeds and prejudices, but to satisfy his own
mind of the truth of things. In this respect we know not which
to be most charmed with, the author or the man. There is an
inexpressible frankness and sincerity, as well as power, in what he
writes. There is no attempt at imposition or concealment, no
juggling tricks or solemn mouthing, no laboured attempts at proving
himself always in the right, and every body else in the wrong; he
says what is uppermost, lays open what floats at the top or the
bottom of his mind, and deserves Pope’s character of him, where
he professes to</p>

      <div class='line'>‘——pour out all as plain</div>

<p class='c017'>He does not converse with us like a pedagogue with his pupil, whom
he wishes to make as great a blockhead as himself, but like a
philosopher and friend who has passed through life with thought
and observation, and is willing to enable others to pass through it
with pleasure and profit. A writer of this stamp, I confess, appears
to me as much superior to a common bookworm, as a library of real
books is superior to a mere book-case, painted and lettered on the
outside with the names of celebrated works. As he was the first
to attempt this new way of writing, so the same strong natural
impulse which prompted the undertaking, carried him to the end
of his career. The same force and honesty of mind which urged
him to throw off the shackles of custom and prejudice, would enable
him to complete his triumph over them. He has left little for his
successors to achieve in the way of just and original speculation on
human life. Nearly all the thinking of the two last centuries of
that kind which the French denominate <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale observatrice</span></i>, is to be
found in Montaigne’s Essays: there is the germ, at least, and
generally much more. He sowed the seed and cleared away the
rubbish, even where others have reaped the fruit, or cultivated and
decorated the soil to a greater degree of nicety and perfection.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>There is no one to whom the old Latin adage is more applicable
than to Montaigne, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pereant isti qui ante nos nostra dixerunt</span></i>.’ There
has been no new impulse given to thought since his time. Among
the specimens of criticisms on authors which he has left us, are
those on Virgil, Ovid, and Boccaccio, in the account of books which
he thinks worth reading, or (which is the same thing) which he
finds he can read in his old age, and which may be reckoned among
the few criticisms which are worth reading at any age.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>Montaigne’s Essays were translated into English by Charles
Cotton, who was one of the wits and poets of the age of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>;
and Lord Halifax, one of the noble critics of that day, declared it
to be ‘the book in the world he was the best pleased with.’ This
mode of familiar Essay-writing, free from the trammels of the
schools, and the airs of professed authorship, was successfully
imitated, about the same time, by Cowley and Sir William Temple,
in their miscellaneous Essays, which are very agreeable and learned
talking upon paper. Lord Shaftesbury, on the contrary, who aimed
at the same easy, <i>degagé</i> mode of communicating his thoughts to
the world, has quite spoiled his matter, which is sometimes valuable,
by his manner, in which he carries a certain flaunting, flowery,
figurative, flirting style of amicable condescension to the reader, to
an excess more tantalising than the most starched and ridiculous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>formality of the age of James <span class='fss'>I.</span> There is nothing so tormenting as
the affectation of ease and freedom from affectation.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ice being thus thawed, and the barrier that kept authors at
a distance from common sense and feeling broken through, the
transition was not difficult from Montaigne and his imitators, to our
Periodical Essayists. These last applied the same unrestrained
expression of their thoughts to the more immediate and passing
scenes of life, to temporary and local matters; and in order to discharge
the invidious office of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Censor Morum</span></i> more freely, and with
less responsibility, assumed some fictitious and humorous disguise,
which, however, in a great degree corresponded to their own
peculiar habits and character. By thus concealing their own name
and person under the title of the Tatler, Spectator, &amp;c. they were
enabled to inform us more fully of what was passing in the world,
while the dramatic contrast and ironical point of view to which the
whole is subjected, added a greater liveliness and <i>piquancy</i> to the
descriptions. The philosopher and wit here commences newsmonger,
makes himself master of ‘the perfect spy o’ th’ time,’
and from his various walks and turns through life, brings home little
curious specimens of the humours, opinions, and manners of his
contemporaries, as the botanist brings home different plants and
weeds, or the mineralogist different shells and fossils, to illustrate
their several theories, and be useful to mankind.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first of these papers that was attempted in this country was
set up by Steele in the beginning of the last century; and of all our
periodical Essayists, the <cite>Tatler</cite> (for that was the name he assumed)
has always appeared to me the most amusing and agreeable.
Montaigne, whom I have proposed to consider as the father of this
kind of personal authorship among the moderns, in which the reader
is admitted behind the curtain, and sits down with the writer in his
gown and slippers, was a most magnanimous and undisguised egotist;
but Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq. was the more disinterested gossip of the
two. The French author is contented to describe the peculiarities
of his own mind and constitution, which he does with a copious
and unsparing hand. The English journalist good-naturedly lets
you into the secret both of his own affairs and those of others. A
young lady, on the other side Temple Bar, cannot be seen at her
glass for half a day together, but Mr. Bickerstaff takes due notice
of it; and he has the first intelligence of the symptoms of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">belle</span></i>
passion appearing in any young gentleman at the West-end of the
town. The departures and arrivals of widows with handsome
jointures, either to bury their grief in the country, or to procure a
second husband in town, are punctually recorded in his pages. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>is well acquainted with the celebrated beauties of the preceding age
at the court of Charles <span class='fss'>II.</span>; and the old gentleman (as he feigns
himself) often grows romantic in recounting ‘the disastrous strokes
which his youth suffered’ from the glances of their bright eyes, and
their unaccountable caprices. In particular, he dwells with a secret
satisfaction on the recollection of one of his mistresses, who left him
for a richer rival, and whose constant reproach to her husband, on
occasion of any quarrel between them, was ‘I, that might have
married the famous Mr. Bickerstaff, to be treated in this manner!’
The club at the Trumpet consists of a set of persons almost as well
worth knowing as himself. The cavalcade of the justice of the
peace, the knight of the shire, the country squire, and the young
gentleman, his nephew, who came to wait on him at his chambers,
in such form and ceremony, seem not to have settled the order of
their precedence to this hour;<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and I should hope that the upholsterer
and his companions, who used to sun themselves in the Green Park,
and who broke their rest and fortunes to maintain the balance of
power in Europe, stand as fair a chance for immortality as some
modern politicians. Mr. Bickerstaff himself is a gentleman and a
scholar, a humourist, and a man of the world; with a great deal of
nice easy <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> about him. If he walks out and is caught in a
shower of rain, he makes amends for this unlucky accident by a
criticism on the shower in Virgil, and concludes with a burlesque
copy of verses on a city-shower. He entertains us, when he dates
from his own apartment, with a quotation from Plutarch, or a moral
reflection; from the Grecian coffee-house with politics; and from
Wills’, or the Temple, with the poets and players, the beaux and
men of wit and pleasure about town. In reading the pages of the
Tatler, we seem as if suddenly carried back to the age of Queen
Anne, of toupees and full-bottomed periwigs. The whole appearance
of our dress and manners undergoes a delightful metamorphosis. The
beaux and the belles are of a quite different species from what they
are at present; we distinguish the dappers, the smarts, and the pretty
fellows, as they pass by Mr. Lilly’s shop-windows in the Strand; we
are introduced to Betterton and Mrs. Oldfield behind the scenes;
are made familiar with the persons and performances of Will Estcourt
or Tom Durfey; we listen to a dispute at a tavern, on the merits
of the Duke of Marlborough, or Marshal Turenne; or are present
at the first rehearsal of a play by Vanbrugh, or the reading of a new
poem by Mr. Pope. The privilege of thus virtually transporting
ourselves to past times, is even greater than that of visiting distant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>places in reality. London, a hundred years ago, would be much
better worth seeing than Paris at the present moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will be said, that all this is to be found, in the same or a greater
degree, in the Spectator. For myself, I do not think so; or at
least, there is in the last work a much greater proportion of commonplace
matter. I have, on this account, always preferred the Tatler
to the Spectator. Whether it is owing to my having been earlier
or better acquainted with the one than the other, my pleasure in
reading these two admirable works is not in proportion to their
comparative reputation. The Tatler contains only half the number
of volumes, and, I will venture to say, nearly an equal quantity of
sterling wit and sense. ‘The first sprightly runnings’ are there;
it has more of the original spirit, more of the freshness and stamp
of nature. The indications of character and strokes of humour are
more true and frequent; the reflections that suggest themselves arise
more from the occasion, and are less spun out into regular dissertations.
They are more like the remarks which occur in sensible conversation,
and less like a lecture. Something is left to the understanding of
the reader. Steele seems to have gone into his closet chiefly to set
down what he observed out of doors. Addison seems to have spent
most of his time in his study, and to have spun out and wire-drawn
the hints, which he borrowed from Steele, or took from nature, to
the utmost. I am far from wishing to depreciate Addison’s talents,
but I am anxious to do justice to Steele, who was, I think, upon
the whole, a less artificial and more original writer. The humorous
descriptions of Steele resemble loose sketches, or fragments of a
comedy; those of Addison are rather comments or ingenious paraphrases
on the genuine text. The characters of the club not only
in the Tatler, but in the Spectator, were drawn by Steele. That of
Sir Roger de Coverley is among the number. Addison has, however,
gained himself immortal honour by his manner of filling up this
last character. Who is there that can forget, or be insensible to,
the inimitable nameless graces and varied traits of nature and of old
English character in it—to his unpretending virtues and amiable
weaknesses—to his modesty, generosity, hospitality, and eccentric
whims—to the respect of his neighbours, and the affection of his
domestics—to his wayward, hopeless, secret passion for his fair
enemy, the widow, in which there is more of real romance and true
delicacy, than in a thousand tales of knight-errantry—(we perceive
the hectic flush of his cheek, the faltering of his tongue in speaking
of her bewitching airs and ‘the whiteness of her hand’)—to the
havoc he makes among the game in his neighbourhood—to his
speech from the bench, to shew the Spectator what is thought of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>him in the country—to his unwillingness to be put up as a sign-post,
and his having his own likeness turned into the Saracen’s head—to
his gentle reproof of the baggage of a gipsy that tells him ‘he has a
widow in his line of life’—to his doubts as to the existence of witchcraft,
and protection of reputed witches—to his account of the family
pictures, and his choice of a chaplain—to his falling asleep at church,
and his reproof of John Williams, as soon as he recovered from his
nap, for talking in sermon-time. The characters of Will. Wimble,
and Will. Honeycomb are not a whit behind their friend, Sir
Roger, in delicacy and felicity. The delightful simplicity and
good-humoured officiousness in the one, are set off by the graceful
affectation and courtly pretension in the other. How long since
I first became acquainted with these two characters in the Spectator!
What old-fashioned friends they seem, and yet I am not tired of
them, like so many other friends, nor they of me! How airy these
abstractions of the poet’s pen stream over the dawn of our acquaintance
with human life! how they glance their fairest colours on the
prospect before us! how pure they remain in it to the last, like
the rainbow in the evening-cloud, which the rude hand of time and
experience can neither soil nor dissipate! What a pity that we
cannot find the reality, and yet if we did, the dream would be over.
I once thought I knew a Will. Wimble, and a Will. Honeycomb,
but they turned out but indifferently; the originals in the Spectator
still read, word for word, the same that they always did. We have
only to turn to the page, and find them where we left them!—Many
of the most exquisite pieces in the Tatler, it is to be observed,
are Addison’s, as the Court of Honour, and the Personification
of Musical Instruments, with almost all those papers that form
regular sets or series. I do not know whether the picture of
the family of an old college acquaintance, in the Tatler, where
the children run to let Mr. Bickerstaff in at the door, and where
the one that loses the race that way, turns back to tell the father
that he is come; with the nice gradation of incredulity in the
little boy, who is got into Guy of Warwick, and the Seven
Champions, and who shakes his head at the improbability of Æsop’s
Fables, is Steele’s or Addison’s, though I believe it belongs to the
former. The account of the two sisters, one of whom held up
her head higher than ordinary, from having on a pair of flowered
garters, and that of the married lady who complained to the Tatler
of the neglect of her husband, with her answers to some <i>home</i>
questions that were put to her, are unquestionably Steele’s.—If
the Tatler is not inferior to the Spectator as a record of manners
and character, it is superior to it in the interest of many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>stories. Several of the incidents related there by Steele have never
been surpassed in the heart-rending pathos of private distress. I
might refer to those of the lover and his mistress, when the theatre,
in which they were, caught fire; of the bridegroom, who by accident
kills his bride on the day of their marriage; the story of Mr.
Eustace and his wife; and the fine dream about his own mistress
when a youth. What has given its superior reputation to the
Spectator, is the greater gravity of its pretensions, its moral dissertations
and critical reasonings, by which I confess myself less
edified than by other things, which are thought more lightly of.
Systems and opinions change, but nature is always true. It is the
moral and didactic tone of the Spectator which makes us apt to
think of Addison (according to Mandeville’s sarcasm) as ‘a parson
in a tie-wig.’ Many of his moral Essays are, however, exquisitely
beautiful and quite happy. Such are the reflections on cheerfulness,
those in Westminster Abbey, on the Royal Exchange, and particularly
some very affecting ones on the death of a young lady in the
fourth volume. These, it must be allowed, are the perfection of
elegant sermonising. His critical Essays are not so good. I prefer
Steele’s occasional selection of beautiful poetical passages, without
any affectation of analysing their beauties, to Addison’s finer-spun
theories. The best criticism in the Spectator, that on the Cartoons
of Raphael, of which Mr. Fuseli has availed himself with great
spirit in his Lectures, is by Steele.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c015'><sup>[20]</sup></a> I owed this acknowledgment
to a writer who has so often put me in good humour with myself,
and every thing about me, when few things else could, and when
the tomes of casuistry and ecclesiastical history, with which the little
duodecimo volumes of the Tatler were overwhelmed and surrounded,
in the only library to which I had access when a boy, had tried
their tranquillising effects upon me in vain. I had not long ago in
my hands, by favour of a friend, an original copy of the quarto
edition of the Tatler, with a list of the subscribers. It is curious
to see some names there which we should hardly think of, (that of
Sir Isaac Newton is among them,) and also to observe the degree
of interest excited by those of the different persons, which is not
determined according to the rules of the Herald’s College. One
literary name lasts as long as a whole race of heroes and their
descendants! The Guardian, which followed the Spectator, was,
as may be supposed, inferior to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The dramatic and conversational turn which forms the distinguishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>feature and greatest charm of the Spectator and Tatler,
is quite lost in the Rambler by Dr. Johnson. There is no reflected
light thrown on human life from an assumed character, nor any direct
one from a display of the author’s own. The Tatler and Spectator
are, as it were, made up of notes and memorandums of the events
and incidents of the day, with finished studies after nature, and
characters fresh from the life, which the writer moralises upon, and
turns to account as they come before him: the Rambler is a collection
of moral Essays, or scholastic theses, written on set subjects,
and of which the individual characters and incidents are merely
artificial illustrations, brought in to give a pretended relief to the
dryness of didactic discussion. The Rambler is a splendid and
imposing common-place book of general topics, and rhetorical declamation
on the conduct and business of human life. In this sense,
there is hardly a reflection that had been suggested on such subjects
which is not to be found in this celebrated work, and there is,
perhaps, hardly a reflection to be found in it which had not been
already suggested and developed by some other author, or in the
common course of conversation. The mass of intellectual wealth
here heaped together is immense, but it is rather the result of gradual
accumulation, the produce of the general intellect, labouring in the
mine of knowledge and reflection, than dug out of the quarry, and
dragged into the light by the industry and sagacity of a single mind.
I am not here saying that Dr. Johnson was a man without originality,
compared with the ordinary run of men’s minds, but he was
not a man of original thought or genius, in the sense in which
Montaigne or Lord Bacon was. He opened no new vein of precious
ore, nor did he light upon any single pebbles of uncommon size and
unrivalled lustre. We seldom meet with any thing to ‘give us
pause;’ he does not set us thinking for the first time. His reflections
present themselves like reminiscences; do not disturb the
ordinary march of our thoughts; arrest our attention by the stateliness
of their appearance, and the costliness of their garb, but pass
on and mingle with the throng of our impressions. After closing
the volumes of the Rambler, there is nothing that we remember
as a new truth gained to the mind, nothing indelibly stamped upon
the memory; nor is there any passage that we wish to turn to as
embodying any known principle or observation, with such force and
beauty that justice can only be done to the idea in the author’s own
words. Such, for instance, are many of the passages to be found in
Burke, which shine by their own light, belong to no class, have
neither equal nor counterpart, and of which we say that no one but
the author could have written them! There is neither the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>boldness of design, nor mastery of execution in Johnson. In the
one, the spark of genius seems to have met with its congenial matter:
the shaft is sped; the forked lightning dresses up the face of nature
in ghastly smiles, and the loud thunder rolls far away from the ruin
that is made. Dr. Johnson’s style, on the contrary, resembles rather
the rumbling of mimic thunder at one of our theatres; and the light
he throws upon a subject is like the dazzling effect of phosphorus, or
an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</span></i> of words. There is a wide difference, however,
between perfect originality and perfect common-place: neither ideas
nor expressions are trite or vulgar because they are not quite new.
They are valuable, and ought to be repeated, if they have not become
quite common; and Johnson’s style both of reasoning and imagery
holds the middle rank between startling novelty and vapid common-place.
Johnson has as much originality of thinking as Addison;
but then he wants his familiarity of illustration, knowledge of character,
and delightful humour.—What most distinguishes Dr. Johnson
from other writers is the pomp and uniformity of his style. All his
periods are cast in the same mould, are of the same size and shape,
and consequently have little fitness to the variety of things he professes
to treat of. His subjects are familiar, but the author is always
upon stilts. He has neither ease nor simplicity, and his efforts at
playfulness, in part, remind one of the lines in Milton:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in14'>‘——The elephant</div>
      <div class='line'>To make them sport wreath’d his proboscis lithe.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>His Letters from Correspondents, in particular, are more pompous
and unwieldy than what he writes in his own person. This want
of relaxation and variety of manner has, I think, after the first effects
of novelty and surprise were over, been prejudicial to the matter. It
takes from the general power, not only to please, but to instruct.
The monotony of style produces an apparent monotony of ideas.
What is really striking and valuable, is lost in the vain ostentation
and circumlocution of the expression; for when we find the same
pains and pomp of diction bestowed upon the most trifling as upon
the most important parts of a sentence or discourse, we grow tired of
distinguishing between pretension and reality, and are disposed to
confound the tinsel and bombast of the phraseology with want of
weight in the thoughts. Thus, from the imposing and oracular
nature of the style, people are tempted at first to imagine that our
author’s speculations are all wisdom and profundity: till having
found out their mistake in some instances, they suppose that there
is nothing but common-place in them, concealed under verbiage and
pedantry; and in both they are wrong. The fault of Dr. Johnson’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>style is, that it reduces all things to the same artificial and unmeaning
level. It destroys all shades of difference, the association between
words and things. It is a perpetual paradox and innovation. He
condescends to the familiar till we are ashamed of our interest in it:
he expands the little till it looks big. ‘If he were to write a fable
of little fishes,’ as Goldsmith said of him, ‘he would make them
speak like great whales.’ We can no more distinguish the most
familiar objects in his descriptions of them, than we can a well-known
face under a huge painted mask. The structure of his
sentences, which was his own invention, and which has been
generally imitated since his time, is a species of rhyming in prose,
where one clause answers to another in measure and quantity, like
the tagging of syllables at the end of a verse; the close of the
period follows as mechanically as the oscillation of a pendulum,
the sense is balanced with the sound; each sentence, revolving
round its centre of gravity, is contained with itself like a couplet,
and each paragraph forms itself into a stanza. Dr. Johnson is also
a complete balance-master in the topics of morality. He never
encourages hope, but he counteracts it by fear; he never elicits a
truth, but he suggests some objection in answer to it. He seizes
and alternately quits the clue of reason, lest it should involve him
in the labyrinths of endless error: he wants confidence in himself
and his fellows. He dares not trust himself with the immediate
impressions of things, for fear of compromising his dignity; or
follow them into their consequences, for fear of committing his
prejudices. His timidity is the result, not of ignorance, but of
morbid apprehension. ‘He runs the great circle, and is still at
home.’ No advance is made by his writings in any sentiment, or
mode of reasoning. Out of the pale of established authority and
received dogmas, all is sceptical, loose, and desultory: he seems
in imagination to strengthen the dominion of prejudice, as he
weakens and dissipates that of reason; and round the rock of faith
and power, on the edge of which he slumbers blindfold and uneasy,
the waves and billows of uncertain and dangerous opinion roar and
heave for evermore. His Rasselas is the most melancholy and
debilitating moral speculation that ever was put forth. Doubtful
of the faculties of his mind, as of his organs of vision, Johnson
trusted only to his feelings and his fears. He cultivated a belief
in witches as an out-guard to the evidences of religion; and abused
Milton, and patronised Lauder, in spite of his aversion to his
countrymen, as a step to secure the existing establishment in church
and state. This was neither right feeling nor sound logic.</p>

<p class='c014'>The most triumphant record of the talents and character of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Johnson is to be found in Boswell’s Life of him. The man was
superior to the author. When he threw aside his pen, which he
regarded as an incumbrance, he became not only learned and
thoughtful, but acute, witty, humorous, natural, honest; hearty
and determined, ‘the king of good fellows and wale of old men.’
There are as many smart repartees, profound remarks, and keen
invectives to be found in Boswell’s ‘inventory of all he said,’ as
are recorded of any celebrated man. The life and dramatic play
of his conversation forms a contrast to his written works. His
natural powers and undisguised opinions were called out in convivial
intercourse. In public, he practised with the foils on: in private,
he unsheathed the sword of controversy, and it was ‘the Ebro’s
temper.’ The eagerness of opposition roused him from his natural
sluggishness and acquired timidity; he returned blow for blow;
and whether the trial were of argument or wit, none of his rivals
could boast much of the encounter. Burke seems to have been the
only person who had a chance with him: and it is the unpardonable
sin of Boswell’s work, that he has purposely omitted their combats of
strength and skill. Goldsmith asked, ‘Does he wind into a subject
like a serpent, as Burke does?’ And when exhausted with sickness,
he himself said, ‘If that fellow Burke were here now, he would kill
me.’ It is to be observed, that Johnson’s colloquial style was as blunt,
direct, and downright, as his style of studied composition was involved
and circuitous. As when Topham Beauclerc and Langton knocked
him up at his chambers, at three in the morning, and he came to the
door with the poker in his hand, but seeing them, exclaimed, ‘What,
is it you, my lads? then I’ll have a frisk with you!’ and he afterwards
reproaches Langton, who was a literary milksop, for leaving
them to go to an engagement ‘with some <i>un-idead</i> girls.’ What
words to come from the mouth of the great moralist and lexicographer!
His good deeds were as many as his good sayings. His
domestic habits, his tenderness to servants, and readiness to oblige
his friends; the quantity of strong tea that he drank to keep down
sad thoughts; his many labours reluctantly begun, and irresolutely
laid aside; his honest acknowledgement of his own, and indulgence
to the weaknesses of others; his throwing himself back in the
post-chaise with Boswell, and saying, ‘Now I think I am a good-humoured
fellow,’ though nobody thought him so, and yet he was;
his quitting the society of Garrick and his actresses, and his reason
for it; his dining with Wilkes, and his kindness to Goldsmith; his
sitting with the young ladies on his knee at the Mitre, to give them
good advice, in which situation, if not explained, he might be taken
for Falstaff; and last and noblest, his carrying the unfortunate victim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>of disease and dissipation on his back up through Fleet Street, (an
act which realises the parable of the good Samaritan)—all these, and
innumerable others, endear him to the reader, and must be remembered
to his lasting honour. He had faults, but they lie buried with him.
He had his prejudices and his intolerant feelings; but he suffered
enough in the conflict of his own mind with them. For if no man
can be happy in the free exercise of his reason, no wise man can be
happy without it. His were not time-serving, heartless, hypocritical
prejudices; but deep, inwoven, not to be rooted out but with life and
hope, which he found from old habit necessary to his own peace of
mind, and thought so to the peace of mankind. I do not hate, but
love him for them. They were between himself and his conscience;
and should be left to that higher tribunal, ‘where they in trembling
hope repose, the bosom of his Father and his God.’ In a word, he
has left behind him few wiser or better men.</p>

<p class='c014'>The herd of his imitators shewed what he was by their disproportionate
effects. The Periodical Essayists, that succeeded the
Rambler, are, and deserve to be, little read at present. The
Adventurer, by Hawksworth, is completely trite and vapid, aping all
the faults of Johnson’s style, without any thing to atone for them.
The sentences are often absolutely unmeaning; and one half of each
might regularly be left blank. The World, and Connoisseur, which
followed, are a little better; and in the last of these there is one good
idea, that of a man in indifferent health, who judges of every one’s
title to respect from their possession of this blessing, and bows to a
sturdy beggar with sound limbs and a florid complexion, while he turns
his back upon a lord who is a valetudinarian.</p>

<p class='c014'>Goldsmith’s Citizen of the World, like all his works, bears the
stamp of the author’s mind. It does not ‘go about to cozen
reputation without the stamp of merit.’ He is more observing, more
original, more natural and picturesque than Johnson. His work is
written on the model of the Persian Letters; and contrives to give
an abstracted and somewhat perplexing view of things, by opposing
foreign prepossessions to our own, and thus stripping objects of their
customary disguises. Whether truth is elicited in this collision of
contrary absurdities, I do not know; but I confess the process is too
ambiguous and full of intricacy to be very amusing to my plain
understanding. For light summer reading, it is like walking in a
garden full of traps and pitfalls. It necessarily gives rise to paradoxes,
and there are some very bold ones in the Essays, which would subject
an author less established to no very agreeable sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">censura literaria</span></i>.
Thus the Chinese philosopher exclaims very unadvisedly, ‘The
bonzes and priests of all religions keep up superstition and imposture:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>all reformations begin with the laity.’ Goldsmith, however, was
staunch in his practical creed, and might bolt speculative extravagances
with impunity. There is a striking difference in this respect between
him and Addison, who, if he attacked authority, took care to have
common sense on his side, and never hazarded any thing offensive to
the feelings of others, or on the strength of his own discretional
opinion. There is another inconvenience in this assumption of an
exotic character and tone of sentiment, that it produces an inconsistency
between the knowledge which the individual has time to
acquire, and which the author is bound to communicate. Thus the
Chinese has not been in England three days before he is acquainted
with the characters of the three countries which compose this
kingdom, and describes them to his friend at Canton, by extracts
from the newspapers of each metropolis. The nationality of
Scotchmen is thus ridiculed:—‘<i>Edinburgh</i>. We are positive when
we say, that Sanders Macgregor, lately executed for horse-stealing, is
not a native of Scotland, but born at Carrickfergus.’ Now this is
very good; but how should our Chinese philosopher find it out by
instinct? Beau Tibbs, a prominent character in this little work, is
the best comic sketch since the time of Addison; unrivalled in his
finery, his vanity, and his poverty.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have only to mention the names of the Lounger and the Mirror,
which are ranked by the author’s admirers with Sterne for sentiment,
and with Addison for humour. I shall not enter into that: but I
know that the story of La Roche is not like the story of Le Fevre,
nor one hundredth part so good. Do I say this from prejudice to
the author? No: for I have read his novels. Of the Man of the
World I cannot think so favourably as some others; nor shall I here
dwell on the picturesque and romantic beauties of Julia de Roubigné,
the early favourite of the author of Rosamond Gray; but of the
Man of Feeling I would speak with grateful recollections: nor is it
possible to forget the sensitive, irresolute, interesting Harley: and
that lone figure of Miss Walton in it, that floats in the horizon, dim
and ethereal, the day-dream of her lover’s youthful fancy—better, far
better than all the realities of life!</p>

  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE VI<br /> <span class='c013'>ON THE ENGLISH NOVELISTS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is an exclamation in one of Gray’s Letters—‘Be mine to
read eternal new romances of Marivaux and Crebillon!’—If I did
not utter a similar aspiration at the conclusion of the last new novel
which I read (I would not give offence by being more particular as
to the name) it was not from any want of affection for the class of
writing to which it belongs: for, without going so far as the celebrated
French philosopher, who thought that more was to be learnt
from good novels and romances than from the gravest treatises on
history and morality, yet there are few works to which I am oftener
tempted to turn for profit or delight, than to the standard productions
in this species of composition. We find there a close imitation of
men and manners; we see the very web and texture of society as it
really exists, and as we meet with it when we come into the world.
If poetry has ‘something more divine in it,’ this savours more of
humanity. We are brought acquainted with the motives and
characters of mankind, imbibe our notions of virtue and vice from
practical examples, and are taught a knowledge of the world through
the airy medium of romance. As a record of past manners and
opinions, too, such writings afford the best and fullest information.
For example, I should be at a loss where to find in any authentic
documents of the same period so satisfactory an account of the
general state of society, and of moral, political, and religious feeling
in the reign of George II. as we meet with in the Adventures of
Joseph Andrews and his friend Mr. Abraham Adams. This work,
indeed, I take to be a perfect piece of statistics in its kind. In
looking into any regular history of that period, into a learned and
eloquent charge to a grand jury or the clergy of a diocese, or into a
tract on controversial divinity, we should hear only of the ascendancy
of the Protestant succession, the horrors of Popery, the triumph of
civil and religious liberty, the wisdom and moderation of the
sovereign, the happiness of the subject, and the flourishing state of
manufactures and commerce. But if we really wish to know what
all these fine-sounding names come to, we cannot do better than turn
to the works of those, who having no other object than to imitate
nature, could only hope for success from the fidelity of their pictures;
and were bound (in self-defence) to reduce the boasts of vague
theorists and the exaggerations of angry disputants to the mortifying
standard of reality. Extremes are said to meet: and the works of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>imagination, as they are called, sometimes come the nearest to truth
and nature. Fielding in speaking on this subject, and vindicating the
use and dignity of the style of writing in which he excelled against
the loftier pretensions of professed historians, says, that in their productions
nothing is true but the names and dates, whereas in his
every thing is true but the names and dates. If so, he has the
advantage on his side.</p>

<p class='c014'>I will here confess, however, that I am a little prejudiced on the
point in question; and that the effect of many fine speculations has
been lost upon me, from an early familiarity with the most striking
passages in the work to which I have just alluded. Thus nothing
can be more captivating than the description somewhere given by
Mr. Burke of the indissoluble connection between learning and
nobility; and of the respect universally paid by wealth to piety and
morals. But the effect of this ideal representation has always been
spoiled by my recollection of Parson Adams sitting over his cup of
ale in Sir Thomas Booby’s kitchen. Echard ‘On the Contempt of
the Clergy’ is, in like manner, a very good book, and ‘worthy of all
acceptation:’ but, somehow, an unlucky impression of the reality of
Parson Trulliber involuntarily checks the emotions of respect, to
which it might otherwise give rise: while, on the other hand, the
lecture which Lady Booby reads to Lawyer Scout on the immediate
expulsion of Joseph and Fanny from the parish, casts no very
favourable light on the flattering accounts of our practical jurisprudence
which are to be found in Blackstone or De Lolme. The most
moral writers, after all, are those who do not pretend to inculcate any
moral. The professed moralist almost unavoidably degenerates into
the partisan of a system; and the philosopher is too apt to warp the
evidence to his own purpose. But the painter of manners gives the
facts of human nature, and leaves us to draw the inference: if we are
not able to do this, or do it ill, at least it is our own fault.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first-rate writers in this class, of course, are few; but those
few we may reckon among the greatest ornaments and best benefactors
of our kind. There is a certain set of them who, as it were, take
their rank by the side of reality, and are appealed to as evidence on
all questions concerning human nature. The principal of these are
Cervantes and Le Sage, who may be considered as having been
naturalised among ourselves; and, of native English growth,
Fielding, Smollett, Richardson, and Sterne.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c015'><sup>[21]</sup></a> As this is a department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>of criticism which deserves more attention than has been usually
bestowed upon it, I shall here venture to recur (not from choice, but
necessity) to what I have said upon it in a well known periodical
publication; and endeavour to contribute my mite towards settling the
standard of excellence, both as to degree and kind, in these several
writers.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shall begin with the history of the renowned Don Quixote de la
Mancha; who presents something more stately, more romantic, and
at the same time more real to the imagination than any other hero
upon record. His lineaments, his accoutrements, his pasteboard
vizor, are familiar to us; and Mambrino’s helmet still glitters in the
sun! We not only feel the greatest veneration and love for the
knight himself, but a certain respect for all those connected with him,
the curate and Master Nicolas the barber, Sancho and Dapple, and
even for Rosinante’s leanness and his errors.—Perhaps there is no
work which combines so much whimsical invention with such an air
of truth. Its popularity is almost unequalled; and yet its merits have
not been sufficiently understood. The story is the least part of
them; though the blunders of Sancho, and the unlucky adventures of
his master, are what naturally catch the attention of the majority of
readers. The pathos and dignity of the sentiments are often
disguised under the ludicrousness of the subject; and provoke
laughter when they might well draw tears. The character of Don
Quixote himself is one of the most perfect disinterestedness. He is
an enthusiast of the most amiable kind; of a nature equally open,
gentle, and generous; a lover of truth and justice; and one who had
brooded over the fine dreams of chivalry and romance, till they had
robbed him of himself, and cheated his brain into a belief of their
reality. There cannot be a greater mistake than to consider Don
Quixote as a merely satirical work, or as a vulgar attempt to
explode ‘the long-forgotten order of chivalry.’ There could be
no need to explode what no longer existed. Besides, Cervantes
himself was a man of the most sanguine and enthusiastic temperament;
and even through the crazed and battered figure of
the knight, the spirit of chivalry shines out with undiminished
lustre; as if the author had half-designed to revive the example
of past ages, and once more ‘witch the world with noble horsemanship.’
Oh! if ever the mouldering flame of Spanish liberty
is destined to break forth, wrapping the tyrant and the tyranny
in one consuming blaze, that the spark of generous sentiment and
romantic enterprise, from which it must be kindled, has not been
quite extinguished, will perhaps be owing to thee, Cervantes, and
to thy Don Quixote!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>The character of Sancho is not more admirable in itself, than as a
relief to that of the knight. The contrast is as picturesque and
striking as that between the figures of Rosinante and Dapple. Never
was there so complete a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie quarrée</span></i>:—they answer to one another
at all points. Nothing need surpass the truth of physiognomy in the
description of the master and man, both as to body and mind; the
one lean and tall, the other round and short; the one heroical and
courteous, the other selfish and servile; the one full of high-flown
fancies, the other a bag of proverbs; the one always starting some
romantic scheme, the other trying to keep to the safe side of custom
and tradition. The gradual ascendancy, however, obtained by Don
Quixote over Sancho, is as finely managed as it is characteristic.
Credulity and a love of the marvellous are as natural to ignorance, as
selfishness and cunning. Sancho by degrees becomes a kind of lay-brother
of the order; acquires a taste for adventures in his own way,
and is made all but an entire convert, by the discovery of the hundred
crowns in one of his most comfortless journeys. Towards the end,
his regret at being forced to give up the pursuit of knight-errantry,
almost equals his master’s; and he seizes the proposal of Don
Quixote for them to turn shepherds with the greatest avidity—still
applying it in his own fashion; for while the Don is ingeniously
torturing the names of his humble acquaintance into classical terminations,
and contriving scenes of gallantry and song, Sancho exclaims,
‘Oh, what delicate wooden spoons shall I carve! what crumbs and
cream shall I devour!’—forgetting, in his milk and fruits, the pullets
and geese at Camacho’s wedding.</p>

<p class='c014'>This intuitive perception of the hidden analogies of things, or, as
it may be called, this <i>instinct of the imagination</i>, is, perhaps, what
stamps the character of genius on the productions of art more than
any other circumstance: for it works unconsciously, like nature, and
receives its impressions from a kind of inspiration. There is as much
of this indistinct keeping and involuntary unity of purpose in
Cervantes, as in any author whatever. Something of the same
unsettled, rambling humour extends itself to all the subordinate parts
and characters of the work. Thus we find the curate confidentially
informing Don Quixote, that if he could get the ear of the government,
he has something of considerable importance to propose for the
good of the state; and our adventurer afterwards (in the course of
his peregrinations) meets with a young gentleman who is a candidate
for poetical honours, with a mad lover, a forsaken damsel, a
Mahometan lady converted to the Christian faith, &amp;c.—all delineated
with the same truth, wildness, and delicacy of fancy. The whole
work breathes that air of romance, that aspiration after imaginary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>good, that indescribable longing after something more than we possess,
that in all places and in all conditions of life,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘——still prompts the eternal sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>For which we wish to live, or dare to die!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The leading characters in Don Quixote are strictly individuals; that
is, they do not so much belong to, as form a class by themselves. In
other words, the actions and manners of the chief <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i> do
not arise out of the actions and manners of those around them, or the
situation of life in which they are placed, but out of the peculiar
dispositions of the persons themselves, operated upon by certain
impulses of caprice and accident. Yet these impulses are so true to
nature, and their operation so exactly described, that we not only
recognise the fidelity of the representation, but recognise it with all
the advantages of novelty superadded. They are in the best sense
<i>originals</i>, namely, in the sense in which nature has her originals.
They are unlike any thing we have seen before—may be said to be
purely ideal; and yet identify themselves more readily with our
imagination, and are retained more strongly in memory, than perhaps
any others: they are never lost in the crowd. One test of the truth
of this ideal painting, is the number of allusions which Don Quixote
has furnished to the whole of civilised Europe; that is to say, of
appropriate cases and striking illustrations of the universal principles
of our nature. The detached incidents and occasional descriptions of
human life are more familiar and obvious; so that we have nearly the
same insight here given us into the characters of innkeepers, barmaids,
ostlers, and puppet-show men, that we have in Fielding.
There is much greater mixture, however, of the pathetic and
sentimental with the quaint and humorous, than there ever is in
Fielding. I might instance the story of the countryman whom Don
Quixote and Sancho met in their doubtful search after Dulcinea,
driving his mules to plough at break of day, and ‘singing the ancient
ballad of Ronscevalles!’ The episodes, which are frequently introduced,
are excellent, but have, upon the whole, been overrated.
They derive their interest from their connexion with the main story.
We are so pleased with that, that we are disposed to receive pleasure
from every thing else. Compared, for instance, with the serious tales
in Boccaccio, they are slight and somewhat superficial. That of
Marcella, the fair shepherdess, is, I think, the best. I shall only
add, that Don Quixote was, at the time it was published, an entirely
original work in its kind, and that the author claims the highest
honour which can belong to one, that of being the inventor of a new
style of writing. I have never read his Galatea, nor his Loves of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Persiles and Sigismunda, though I have often meant to do it, and I
hope to do so yet. Perhaps there is a reason lurking at the bottom
of this dilatoriness: I am quite sure the reading of these works could
not make me think higher of the author of Don Quixote, and it
might, for a moment or two, make me think less.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is another Spanish novel, Gusman D’Alfarache, nearly of
the same age as Don Quixote, and of great genius, though it can
hardly be ranked as a novel or a work of imagination. It is a series
of strange, unconnected adventures, rather drily told, but accompanied
by the most severe and sarcastic commentary. The satire, the wit,
the eloquence and reasoning, are of the most potent kind: but they
are didactic rather than dramatic. They would suit a homily or a
pasquinade as well or better than a romance. Still there are in this
extraordinary book occasional sketches of character and humorous
descriptions, to which it would be difficult to produce any thing
superior. This work, which is hardly known in this country except
by name, has the credit, without any reason, of being the original of
Gil Blas. There is one incident the same, that of the unsavoury
ragout, which is served up for supper at the inn. In all other respects
these two works are the very reverse of each other, both in their
excellences and defects.—Lazarillo de Tormes has been more read
than the Spanish Rogue, and is a work more readable, on this
account among others, that it is contained in a duodecimo instead of
a folio volume. This, however, is long enough, considering that it
treats of only one subject, that of eating, or rather the possibility of
living without eating. Famine is here framed into an art, and
feasting is banished far hence. The hero’s time and thoughts are
taken up in a thousand shifts to procure a dinner; and that failing, in
tampering with his stomach till supper time, when being forced to go
supperless to bed, he comforts himself with the hopes of a breakfast
the next morning, of which being again disappointed, he reserves his
appetite for a luncheon, and then has to stave it off again by some
meagre excuse or other till dinner; and so on, by a perpetual adjournment
of this necessary process, through the four and twenty hours
round. The quantity of food proper to keep body and soul together
is reduced to a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimum</span></i>; and the most uninviting morsels with which
Lazarillo meets once a week as a God’s-send, are pampered into the
most sumptuous fare by a long course of inanition. The scene of this
novel could be laid nowhere so properly as in Spain, that land of
priestcraft and poverty, where hunger seems to be the ruling passion,
and starving the order of the day.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gil Blas has, next to Don Quixote, been more generally read and
admired than any other novel; and in one sense, deservedly so: for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>it is at the head of its class, though that class is very different from,
and I should say inferior to the other. There is little individual
character in Gil Blas. The author is a describer of manners, and
not of character. He does not take the elements of human nature,
and work them up into new combinations (which is the excellence of
Don Quixote); nor trace the peculiar and shifting shades of folly
and knavery as they are to be found in real life (like Fielding): but
he takes off, as it were, the general, habitual impression which circumstances
make on certain conditions of life, and moulds all his
characters accordingly. All the persons whom he introduces, carry
about with them the badge of their profession; and you see little
more of them than their costume. He describes men as belonging to
distinct classes in society; not as they are in themselves, or with the
individual differences which are always to be discovered in nature.
His hero, in particular, has no character but that of the successive
circumstances in which he is placed. His priests are only described
as priests: his valets, his players, his women, his courtiers and his
sharpers, are all alike. Nothing can well exceed the monotony of
the work in this respect:—at the same time that nothing can exceed
the truth and precision with which the general manners of these
different characters are preserved, nor the felicity of the particular
traits by which their common foibles are brought out. Thus the
Archbishop of Grenada will remain an everlasting memento of the
weakness of human vanity; and the account of Gil Blas’ legacy, of
the uncertainty of human expectations. This novel is also deficient
in the fable as well as in the characters. It is not a regularly constructed
story; but a series of amusing adventures told with equal
gaiety and good sense, and in the most graceful style imaginable.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been usual to class our own great novelists as imitators of
one or other of these two writers. Fielding, no doubt, is more like
Don Quixote than Gil Blas; Smollett is more like Gil Blas than
Don Quixote; but there is not much resemblance in either case.
Sterne’s Tristram Shandy is a more direct instance of imitation.
Richardson can scarcely be called an imitator of any one; or if he is,
it is of the sentimental refinement of Marivaux, or of the verbose
gallantry of the writers of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is very little to warrant the common idea that Fielding was
an imitator of Cervantes, except his own declaration of such an
intention in the title-page of Joseph Andrews, the romantic turn of
the character of Parson Adams (the only romantic character in his
works), and the proverbial humour of Partridge, which is kept up
only for a few pages. Fielding’s novels are, in general, thoroughly
his own; and they are thoroughly English. What they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>most remarkable for, is neither sentiment, nor imagination, nor wit, nor
even humour, though there is an immense deal of this last quality;
but profound knowledge of human nature, at least of English nature;
and masterly pictures of the characters of men as he saw them
existing. This quality distinguishes all his works, and is shown
almost equally in all of them. As a painter of real life, he was equal
to Hogarth; as a mere observer of human nature, he was little
inferior to Shakspeare, though without any of the genius and poetical
qualities of his mind. His humour is less rich and laughable than
Smollett’s; his wit as often misses as hits; he has none of the fine
pathos of Richardson or Sterne; but he has brought together a
greater variety of characters in common life, marked with more
distinct peculiarities, and without an atom of caricature, than any
other novel writer whatever. The extreme subtlety of observation on
the springs of human conduct in ordinary characters, is only equalled
by the ingenuity of contrivance in bringing those springs into play, in
such a manner as to lay open their smallest irregularity. The
detection is always complete, and made with the certainty and skill
of a philosophical experiment, and the obviousness and familiarity of
a casual observation. The truth of the imitation is indeed so great,
that it has been argued that Fielding must have had his materials
ready-made to his hands, and was merely a transcriber of local
manners and individual habits. For this conjecture, however, there
seems to be no foundation. His representations, it is true, are local
and individual; but they are not the less profound and conclusive.
The feeling of the general principles of human nature operating in
particular circumstances, is always intense, and uppermost in his
mind; and he makes use of incident and situation only to bring out
character.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is scarcely necessary to give any illustrations. Tom Jones is
full of them. There is the account, for example, of the gratitude of
the elder Blifil to his brother, for assisting him to obtain the fortune
of Miss Bridget Alworthy by marriage; and of the gratitude of the
poor in his neighbourhood to Alworthy himself, who had done so
much good in the country that he had made every one in it his
enemy. There is the account of the Latin dialogues between
Partridge and his maid, of the assault made on him during one of
these by Mrs. Partridge, and the severe bruises he patiently received
on that occasion, after which the parish of Little Baddington rung
with the story, that the school-master had killed his wife. There is
the exquisite keeping in the character of Blifil, and the want of it in
that of Jones. There is the gradation in the lovers of Molly
Seagrim; the philosopher Square succeeding to Tom Jones, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>again finds that he himself had succeeded to the accomplished Will.
Barnes, who had the first possession of her person, and had still
possession of her heart, Jones being only the instrument of her vanity,
as Square was of her interest. Then there is the discreet honesty of
Black George, the learning of Thwackum and Square, and the
profundity of Squire Western, who considered it as a physical
impossibility that his daughter should fall in love with Tom Jones.
We have also that gentleman’s disputes with his sister, and the
inimitable appeal of that lady to her niece.—‘I was never so handsome
as you, Sophy: yet I had something of you formerly. I was
called the cruel Parthenissa. Kingdoms and states, as Tully Cicero
says, undergo alteration, and so must the human form!’ The
adventure of the same lady with the highwayman, who robbed her
of her jewels, while he complimented her beauty, ought not to be
passed over, nor that of Sophia and her muff, nor the reserved
coquetry of her cousin Fitzpatrick, nor the description of Lady
Bellaston, nor the modest overtures of the pretty widow Hunt, nor
the indiscreet babblings of Mrs. Honour. The moral of this book
has been objected to, without much reason; but a more serious
objection has been made to the want of refinement and elegance in
two principal characters. We never feel this objection, indeed,
while we are reading the book: but at other times, we have something
like a lurking suspicion that Jones was but an awkward fellow,
and Sophia a pretty simpleton. I do not know how to account for
this effect, unless it is that Fielding’s constantly assuring us of the
beauty of his hero, and the good sense of his heroine, at last produces
a distrust of both. The story of Tom Jones is allowed to be unrivalled:
and it is this circumstance, together with the vast variety of
characters, that has given the history of a Foundling so decided a
preference over Fielding’s other novels. The characters themselves,
both in Amelia and Joseph Andrews, are quite equal to any of those
in Tom Jones. The account of Miss Matthews and Ensign Hibbert,
in the former of these; the way in which that lady reconciles herself
to the death of her father; the inflexible Colonel Bath; the insipid
Mrs. James, the complaisant Colonel Trent, the demure, sly, intriguing,
equivocal Mrs. Bennet, the lord who is her seducer, and who attempts
afterwards to seduce Amelia by the same mechanical process of a
concert-ticket, a book, and the disguise of a great coat; his little, fat,
short-nosed, red-faced, good-humoured accomplice, the keeper of the
lodging-house, who, having no pretensions to gallantry herself, has a
disinterested delight in forwarding the intrigues and pleasures of
others, (to say nothing of honest Atkinson, the story of the miniature-picture
of Amelia, and the hashed mutton, which are in a different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>style,) are masterpieces of description. The whole scene at the
lodging-house, the masquerade, &amp;c. in Amelia, are equal in interest to
the parallel scenes in Tom Jones, and even more refined in the
knowledge of character. For instance, Mrs. Bennet is superior to
Mrs. Fitzpatrick in her own way. The uncertainty, in which the
event of her interview with her former seducer is left, is admirable.
Fielding was a master of what may be called the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i> of
character, and surprises you no less by what he leaves in the dark,
(hardly known to the persons themselves) than by the unexpected
discoveries he makes of the real traits and circumstances in a character
with which, till then, you find you were unacquainted. There is
nothing at all heroic, however, in the usual style of his delineations.
He does not draw lofty characters or strong passions; all his persons
are of the ordinary stature as to intellect; and possess little elevation
of fancy, or energy of purpose. Perhaps, after all, Parson Adams is
his finest character. It is equally true to nature, and more ideal than
any of the others. Its unsuspecting simplicity makes it not only more
amiable, but doubly amusing, by gratifying the sense of superior
sagacity in the reader. Our laughing at him does not once lessen our
respect for him. His declaring that he would willingly walk ten
miles to fetch his sermon on vanity, merely to convince Wilson of his
thorough contempt of this vice, and his consoling himself for the loss
of his Æschylus, by suddenly recollecting that he could not read it if
he had it, because it is dark, are among the finest touches of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>.
The night-adventures at Lady Booby’s with Beau Didapper, and the
amiable Slipslop, are the most ludicrous; and that with the huntsman,
who draws off the hounds from the poor Parson, because they would
be spoiled by following <i>vermin</i>, the most profound. Fielding did not
often repeat himself; but Dr. Harrison, in Amelia, may be considered
as a variation of the character of Adams: so also is Goldsmith’s
Vicar of Wakefield; and the latter part of that work, which sets out
so delightfully, an almost entire plagiarism from Wilson’s account of
himself, and Adams’s domestic history.</p>

<p class='c014'>Smollett’s first novel, Roderick Random, which is also his best,
appeared about the same time as Fielding’s Tom Jones; and yet it
has a much more modern air with it: but this may be accounted for,
from the circumstance that Smollett was quite a young man at the
time, whereas Fielding’s manner must have been formed long before.
The style of Roderick Random is more easy and flowing than that
of Tom Jones; the incidents follow one another more rapidly
(though, it must be confessed, they never come in such a throng, or
are brought out with the same dramatic effect); the humour is
broader, and as effectual; and there is very nearly, if not quite, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>equal interest excited by the story. What then is it that gives the
superiority to Fielding? It is the superior insight into the springs of
human character, and the constant developement of that character
through every change of circumstance. Smollett’s humour often
arises from the situation of the persons, or the peculiarity of their
external appearance; as, from Roderick Random’s carrotty locks,
which hung down over his shoulders like a pound of candles, or
Strap’s ignorance of London, and the blunders that follow from it.
There is a tone of vulgarity about all his productions. The incidents
frequently resemble detached anecdotes taken from a newspaper or
magazine; and, like those in Gil Blas, might happen to a hundred
other characters. He exhibits the ridiculous accidents and reverses
to which human life is liable, not ‘the stuff’ of which it is composed.
He seldom probes to the quick, or penetrates beyond the surface;
and, therefore, he leaves no stings in the minds of his readers, and in
this respect is far less interesting than Fielding. His novels always
enliven, and never tire us: we take them up with pleasure, and lay
them down without any strong feeling of regret. We look on and
laugh, as spectators of a highly amusing scene, without closing in with
the combatants, or being made parties in the event. We read
Roderick Random as an entertaining story; for the particular
accidents and modes of life which it describes have ceased to exist:
but we regard Tom Jones as a real history; because the author never
stops short of those essential principles which lie at the bottom of all
our actions, and in which we feel an immediate interest—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">intus et in
cute</span></i>. Smollett excels most as the lively caricaturist: Fielding as the
exact painter and profound metaphysician. I am far from maintaining
that this account applies uniformly to the productions of these two
writers; but I think that, as far as they essentially differ, what I have
stated is the general distinction between them. Roderick Random
is the purest of Smollett’s novels: I mean in point of style and
description. Most of the incidents and characters are supposed to
have been taken from the events of his own life; and are, therefore,
truer to nature. There is a rude conception of generosity in some of
his characters, of which Fielding seems to have been incapable, his
amiable persons being merely good-natured. It is owing to this that
Strap is superior to Partridge; as there is a heartiness and warmth of
feeling in some of the scenes between Lieutenant Bowling and his
nephew, which is beyond Fielding’s power of impassioned writing.
The whole of the scene on ship-board is a most admirable and striking
picture, and, I imagine, very little if at all exaggerated, though the
interest it excites is of a very unpleasant kind, because the irritation
and resistance to petty oppression can be of no avail. The picture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the little profligate French friar, who was Roderick’s travelling companion,
and of whom he always kept to the windward, is one of
Smollett’s most masterly sketches.—Peregrine Pickle is no great
favourite of mine, and Launcelot Greaves was not worthy of the
genius of the author.</p>

<p class='c014'>Humphry Clinker and Count Fathom are both equally admirable
in their way. Perhaps the former is the most pleasant gossiping
novel that ever was written; that which gives the most pleasure with
the least effort to the reader. It is quite as amusing as going the
journey could have been; and we have just as good an idea of what
happened on the road, as if we had been of the party. Humphry
Clinker himself is exquisite; and his sweetheart, Winifred Jenkins,
not much behind him. Matthew Bramble, though not altogether
original, is excellently supported, and seems to have been the
prototype of Sir Anthony Absolute in the Rivals. But Lismahago
is the flower of the flock. His tenaciousness in argument is not so
delightful as the relaxation of his logical severity, when he finds his
fortune mellowing in the wintry smiles of Mrs. Tabitha Bramble.
This is the best preserved, and most severe of all Smollett’s characters.
The resemblance to Don Quixote is only just enough to make it
interesting to the critical reader, without giving offence to any body
else. The indecency and filth in this novel, are what must be
allowed to all Smollett’s writings.—The subject and characters in
Count Fathom are, in general, exceedingly disgusting: the story is
also spun out to a degree of tediousness in the serious and sentimental
parts; but there is more power of writing occasionally shewn in it
than in any of his works. I need only to refer to the fine and bitter
irony of the Count’s address to the country of his ancestors on his
landing in England; to the robber scene in the forest, which has
never been surpassed; to the Parisian swindler who personates a raw
English country squire (Western is tame in the comparison); and to
the story of the seduction in the west of England. It would be
difficult to point out, in any author, passages written with more force
and mastery than these.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not a very difficult undertaking to class Fielding or Smollett;—the
one as an observer of the characters of human life, the other as
a describer of its various eccentricities. But it is by no means so
easy to dispose of Richardson, who was neither an observer of the
one, nor a describer of the other; but who seemed to spin his
materials entirely out of his own brain, as if there had been nothing
existing in the world beyond the little room in which he sat writing.
There is an artificial reality about his works, which is no where else
to be met with. They have the romantic air of a pure fiction, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the literal minuteness of a common diary. The author had the
strongest matter-of-fact imagination that ever existed, and wrote the
oddest mixture of poetry and prose. He does not appear to have
taken advantage of any thing in actual nature, from one end of his
works to the other; and yet, throughout all his works, voluminous as
they are—(and this, to be sure, is one reason why they are so,)—he
sets about describing every object and transaction, as if the whole had
been given in on evidence by an eye-witness. This kind of high
finishing from imagination is an anomaly in the history of human
genius; and, certainly, nothing so fine was ever produced by the same
accumulation of minute parts. There is not the least distraction, the
least forgetfulness of the end: every circumstance is made to tell.
I cannot agree that this exactness of detail produces heaviness; on
the contrary, it gives an appearance of truth, and a positive interest to
the story; and we listen with the same attention as we should to the
particulars of a confidential communication. I at one time used to
think some parts of Sir Charles Grandison rather trifling and
tedious, especially the long description of Miss Harriet Byron’s
wedding clothes, till I was told of two young ladies who had severally
copied out the whole of that very description for their own private
gratification. After that, I could not blame the author.</p>

<p class='c014'>The effect of reading this work is like an increase of kindred.
You find yourself all of a sudden introduced into the midst of a large
family, with aunts and cousins to the third and fourth generation, and
grandmothers both by the father’s and mother’s side;—and a very
odd set of people they are, but people whose real existence and
personal identity you can no more dispute than your own senses, for
you see and hear all that they do or say. What is still more
extraordinary, all this extreme elaborateness in working out the
story, seems to have cost the author nothing; for it is said, that the
published works are mere abridgments. I have heard (though this
I suspect must be a pleasant exaggeration) that Sir Charles Grandison
was originally written in eight and twenty volumes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pamela is the first of Richardson’s productions, and the very child
of his brain. Taking the general idea of the character of a modest
and beautiful country girl, and of the ordinary situation in which she
is placed, he makes out all the rest, even to the smallest circumstance,
by the mere force of a reasoning imagination. It would seem as if a
step lost, would be as fatal here as in a mathematical demonstration.
The developement of the character is the most simple, and comes the
nearest to nature that it can do, without being the same thing. The
interest of the story increases with the dawn of understanding and
reflection in the heroine: her sentiments gradually expand themselves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>like opening flowers. She writes better every time, and acquires a
confidence in herself, just as a girl would do, writing such letters in
such circumstances; and yet it is certain <i>that no girl would write such
letters in such circumstances</i>. What I mean is this:—Richardson’s
nature is always the nature of sentiment and reflection, not of impulse
or situation. He furnishes his characters, on every occasion, with
the presence of mind of the author. He makes them act, not as
they would from the impulse of the moment, but as they might upon
reflection, and upon a careful review of every motive and circumstance
in their situation. They regularly sit down to write letters: and if
the business of life consisted in letter-writing, and was carried on by
the post (like a Spanish game at chess), human nature would be what
Richardson represents it. All actual objects and feelings are blunted
and deadened by being presented through a medium which may be
true to reason, but is false in nature. He confounds his own point of
view with that of the immediate actors in the scene; and hence
presents you with a conventional and factitious nature, instead of that
which is real. Dr. Johnson seems to have preferred this truth of
reflection to the truth of nature, when he said that there was more
knowledge of the human heart in a page of Richardson, than in all
Fielding. Fielding, however, saw more of the practical results, and
understood the principles as well; but he had not the same power of
speculating upon their possible results, and combining them in certain
ideal forms of passion and imagination, which was Richardson’s real
excellence.</p>

<p class='c014'>It must be observed, however, that it is this mutual good understanding,
and comparing of notes between the author and the persons
he describes; his infinite circumspection, his exact process of ratiocination
and calculation, which gives such an appearance of coldness
and formality to most of his characters,—which makes prudes of his
women, and coxcombs of his men. Every thing is too conscious in
his works. Every thing is distinctly brought home to the mind of
the actors in the scene, which is a fault undoubtedly: but then it
must be confessed, every thing is brought home in its full force to the
mind of the reader also; and we feel the same interest in the story
as if it were our own. Can any thing be more beautiful or more
affecting than Pamela’s reproaches to her ‘lumpish heart,’ when she
is sent away from her master’s at her own request; its lightness,
when she is sent for back; the joy which the conviction of the
sincerity of his love diffuses in her heart, like the coming on of
spring; the artifice of the stuff gown; the meeting with Lady
Davers after her marriage; and the trial-scene with her husband?
Who ever remained insensible to the passion of Lady Clementina,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>except Sir Charles Grandison himself, who was the object of it?
Clarissa is, however, his masterpiece, if we except Lovelace. If she
is fine in herself, she is still finer in his account of her. With that
foil, her purity is dazzling indeed: and she who could triumph by
her virtue, and the force of her love, over the regality of Lovelace’s
mind, his wit, his person, his accomplishments, and his spirit,
conquers all hearts. I should suppose that never sympathy more
deep or sincere was excited than by the heroine of Richardson’s
romance, except by the calamities of real life. The links in this
wonderful chain of interest are not more finely wrought, than their
whole weight is overwhelming and irresistible. Who can forget the
exquisite gradations of her long dying-scene, or the closing of the
coffin-lid, when Miss Howe comes to take her last leave of her
friend; or the heart-breaking reflection that Clarissa makes on what
was to have been her wedding-day? Well does a certain writer
exclaim—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Books are a real world, both pure and good,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round which, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Our pastime and our happiness may grow!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Richardson’s wit was unlike that of any other writer—his humour
was so too. Both were the effect of intense activity of mind—laboured,
and yet completely effectual. I might refer to Lovelace’s
reception and description of Hickman, when he calls out Death in
his ear, as the name of the person with whom Clarissa had fallen in
love; and to the scene at the glove-shop. What can be more
magnificent than his enumeration of his companions—‘Belton, so
pert and so pimply—Tourville, so fair and so foppish!’ &amp;c. In
casuistry this author is quite at home; and, with a boldness greater
even than his puritanical severity, has exhausted every topic on virtue
and vice. There is another peculiarity in Richardson, not perhaps
so uncommon, which is, his systematically preferring his most insipid
characters to his finest, though both were equally his own invention,
and he must be supposed to have understood something of their
qualities. Thus he preferred the little, selfish, affected, insignificant
Miss Byron, to the divine Clementina; and again, Sir Charles
Grandison, to the nobler Lovelace. I have nothing to say in favour
of Lovelace’s morality; but Sir Charles is the prince of coxcombs,—whose
eye was never once taken from his own person, and his own
virtues; and there is nothing which excites so little sympathy as this
excessive egotism.</p>

<p class='c014'>It remains to speak of Sterne; and I shall do it in few words.
There is more of <i>mannerism</i> and affectation in him, and a more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>immediate reference to preceding authors; but his excellences, where
he is excellent, are of the first order. His characters are intellectual
and inventive, like Richardson’s; but totally opposite in the execution.
The one are made out by continuity, and patient repetition of touches:
the others, by glancing transitions and graceful apposition. His style
is equally different from Richardson’s: it is at times the most rapid,
the most happy, the most idiomatic of any that is to be found. It
is the pure essence of English conversational style. His works
consist only of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceaux</span></i>—of brilliant passages. I wonder that
Goldsmith, who ought to have known better, should call him ‘a dull
fellow.’ His wit is poignant, though artificial; and his characters
(though the groundwork of some of them had been laid before) have
yet invaluable original differences; and the spirit of the execution,
the master-strokes constantly thrown into them, are not to be
surpassed. It is sufficient to name them;—Yorick, Dr. Slop, Mr.
Shandy, My Uncle Toby, Trim, Susanna, and the Widow Wadman.
In these he has contrived to oppose, with equal felicity and originality,
two characters, one of pure intellect, and the other of pure good
nature, in My Father and My Uncle Toby. There appears to have
been in Sterne a vein of dry, sarcastic humour, and of extreme
tenderness of feeling; the latter sometimes carried to affectation, as
in the tale of Maria, and the apostrophe to the recording angel: but
at other times pure, and without blemish. The story of Le Fevre
is perhaps the finest in the English language. My Father’s
restlessness, both of body and mind, is inimitable. It is the model
from which all those despicable performances against modern
philosophy ought to have been copied, if their authors had known any
thing of the subject they were writing about. My Uncle Toby is
one of the finest compliments ever paid to human nature. He is the
most unoffending of God’s creatures; or, as the French express it,
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un tel petit bon homme</span></i>! Of his bowling-green, his sieges, and his
amours, who would say or think any thing amiss!</p>

<p class='c014'>It is remarkable that our four best novel-writers belong nearly to
the same age. We also owe to the same period (the reign of
George II.) the inimitable Hogarth, and some of our best writers
of the middle style of comedy. If I were called upon to account for
this coincidence, I should wave the consideration of more general
causes, and ascribe it at once to the establishment of the Protestant
ascendancy, and the succession of the House of Hanover. These
great events appear to have given a more popular turn to our literature
and genius, as well as to our government. It was found high time
that the people should be represented in books as well as in Parliament.
They wished to see some account of themselves in what they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>read; and not to be confined always to the vices, the miseries, and
frivolities of the great. Our domestic tragedy, and our earliest
periodical works, appeared a little before the same period. In
despotic countries, human nature is not of sufficient importance to be
studied or described. The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille</span></i> are objects rather of disgust than
curiosity; and there are no middle classes. The works of Racine
and Moliere are either imitations of the verbiage of the court, before
which they were represented, or fanciful caricatures of the manners of
the lowest of the people. But in the period of our history in question,
a security of person and property, and a freedom of opinion had been
established, which made every man feel of some consequence to himself,
and appear an object of some curiosity to his neighbours: our
manners became more domesticated; there was a general spirit of
sturdiness and independence, which made the English character more
truly English than perhaps at any other period—that is, more
tenacious of its own opinions and purposes. The whole surface of
society appeared cut out into square enclosures and sharp angles,
which extended to the dresses of the time, their gravel-walks, and
clipped hedges. Each individual had a certain ground-plot of his
own to cultivate his particular humours in, and let them shoot out at
pleasure; and a most plentiful crop they have produced accordingly.
The reign of George <span class='fss'>II.</span> was, in a word, the age of <i>hobby-horses</i>:
but, since that period, things have taken a different turn.</p>

<p class='c014'>His present Majesty (God save the mark!) during almost the
whole of his reign, has been constantly mounted on a great war-horse;
and has fairly driven all competitors out of the field. Instead of
minding our own affairs, or laughing at each other, the eyes of all his
faithful subjects have been fixed on the career of the sovereign, and
all hearts anxious for the safety of his person and government. Our
pens and our swords have been alike drawn in their defence; and the
returns of killed and wounded, the manufacture of newspapers and
parliamentary speeches, have exceeded all former example. If we
have had little of the blessings of peace, we have had enough of the
glories and calamities of war. His Majesty has indeed contrived to
keep alive the greatest public interest ever known, by his determined
manner of riding his hobby for half a century together, with the
aristocracy, the democracy, the clergy, the landed and monied
interest, and the rabble, in full cry after him;—and at the end of his
career, most happily and unexpectedly succeeded, amidst empires
lost and won, kingdoms overturned and created, and the destruction
of an incredible number of lives, in restoring <i>the divine right of kings</i>,
and thus preventing any future abuse of the example which seated his
family on the throne!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>It is not to be wondered at, if amidst the tumult of events crowded
into this period, our literature has partaken of the disorder of the
time; if our prose has run mad, and our poetry grown childish.
Among those persons who ‘have kept the even tenor of their way,’
the author of Evelina, Cecilia, and Camilla, must be allowed to hold
a distinguished place.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c015'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Mrs. Radcliffe’s ‘enchantments drear,’ and
mouldering castles, derived part of their interest, no doubt, from the
supposed tottering state of all old structures at the time; and Mrs.
Inchbald’s ‘Nature and Art’ would scarcely have had the same
popularity, but that it fell in (as to its two main characters) with the
prevailing prejudice of the moment, that judges and bishops were not
invariably pure abstractions of justice and piety. Miss Edgeworth’s
Tales again (with the exception of Castle Rack-rent, which is a
genuine, unsophisticated, national portrait) are a kind of pedantic,
pragmatical common sense, tinctured with the pertness and pretensions
of the paradoxes to which they are so self-complacently opposed.
Madame D’Arblay is, on the contrary, quite of the old school, a
mere common observer of manners, and also a very woman. It is
this last circumstance which forms the peculiarity of her writings, and
distinguishes them from those masterpieces which I have before
mentioned. She is a quick, lively, and accurate observer of persons
and things; but she always looks at them with a consciousness of her
sex, and in that point of view in which it is the particular business and
interest of women to observe them. There is little in her works of
passion or character, or even manners, in the most extended sense of
the word, as implying the sum-total of our habits and pursuits; her
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is in describing the absurdities and affectations of external
behaviour, or <i>the manners of people in company</i>. Her characters, which
are ingenious caricatures, are, no doubt, distinctly marked, and well
kept up; but they are slightly shaded, and exceedingly uniform.
Her heroes and heroines, almost all of them, depend on the stock of
a single phrase or sentiment, and have certain mottoes or devices by
which they may always be known. They form such characters as
people might be supposed to assume for a night at a masquerade.
She presents, not the whole-length figure, nor even the face, but some
prominent feature. In one of her novels, for example, a lady appears
regularly every ten pages, to get a lesson in music for nothing. She
never appears for any other purpose; this is all you know of her;
and in this the whole wit and humour of the character consists.
Meadows is the same, who has always the cue of being tired, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>any other idea. It has been said of Shakspeare, that you may
always assign his speeches to the proper characters;—and you may
infallibly do the same thing with Madame D’Arblay’s, for they
always say the same thing. The Branghtons are the best. Mr.
Smith is an exquisite city portrait. Evelina is also her best novel,
because it is the shortest; that is, it has all the liveliness in the
sketches of character, and smartness of common dialogue and repartee,
without the tediousness of the story, and endless affectation of
sentiment which disfigures the others.</p>

<p class='c014'>Women, in general, have a quicker perception of any oddity or
singularity of character than men, and are more alive to every
absurdity which arises from a violation of the rules of society, or a
deviation from established custom. This partly arises from the
restraints on their own behaviour, which turn their attention constantly
on the subject, and partly from other causes. The surface of their
minds, like that of their bodies, seems of a finer texture than ours;
more soft, and susceptible of immediate impulses. They have less
muscular strength; less power of continued voluntary attention—of
reason, passion, and imagination: but they are more easily impressed
with whatever appeals to their senses or habitual prejudices. The
intuitive perception of their minds is less disturbed by any abstruse
reasonings on causes or consequences. They learn the idiom of
character and manners, as they acquire that of language, by rote,
without troubling themselves about the principles. Their observation
is not the less accurate on that account, as far as it
goes; for it has been well said, that ‘there is nothing so true as
habit.’</p>

<p class='c014'>There is little other power in Miss Burney’s novels, than that of
immediate observation: her characters, whether of refinement or
vulgarity, are equally superficial and confined. The whole is a
question of form, whether that form is adhered to or infringed upon.
It is this circumstance which takes away dignity and interest from
her story and sentiments, and makes the one so teazing and tedious,
and the other so insipid. The difficulties in which she involves her
heroines are too much ‘Female Difficulties’; they are difficulties
created out of nothing. The author appears to have no other idea of
refinement than that it is the reverse of vulgarity; but the reverse of
vulgarity is fastidiousness and affectation. There is a true and a
false delicacy. Because a vulgar country Miss would answer ‘yes’
to a proposal of marriage in the first page, Madame D’Arblay makes
it a proof of an excess of refinement, and an indispensable point
of etiquette in her young ladies, to postpone the answer to the end of
five volumes, without the smallest reason for their doing so, and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>every reason to the contrary. The reader is led every moment to
expect a <i>denouement</i>, and is as often disappointed on some trifling
pretext. The whole artifice of her fable consists in coming to no
conclusion. Her ladies ‘stand so upon the order of their going,’ that
they do not go at all. They will not abate an ace of their punctilio
in any circumstances, or on any emergency. They would consider it
as quite indecorous to run down stairs though the house were in
flames, or to move an inch off the pavement though a scaffolding was
falling. She has formed to herself an abstract idea of perfection in
common behaviour, which is quite as romantic and impracticable as
any other idea of the sort: and the consequence has naturally been,
that she makes her heroines commit the greatest improprieties and
absurdities in order to avoid the smallest. In opposition to a maxim
in philosophy, they constantly act from the weakest motive, or rather
from pure contradiction. The whole tissue of the fable is, in general,
more wild and chimerical than any thing in Don Quixote, without
the poetical truth or elevation. Madame D’Arblay has woven a
web of difficulties for her heroines, something like the green silken
threads in which the shepherdesses entangled the steed of Cervantes’s
hero, who swore, in his fine enthusiastic way, that he would sooner
cut his passage to another world than disturb the least of those
beautiful meshes. To mention the most painful instance—the
Wanderer, in her last novel, raises obstacles, lighter than ‘the
gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air,’ into insurmountable
barriers; and trifles with those that arise out of common sense, reason,
and necessity. Her conduct is not to be accounted for directly out
of the circumstances in which she is placed, but out of some factitious
and misplaced refinement on them. It is a perpetual game at cross-purposes.
There being a plain and strong motive why she should
pursue any course of action, is a sufficient reason for her to avoid it;
and the perversity of her conduct is in proportion to its levity—as the
lightness of the feather baffles the force of the impulse that is given to
it, and the slightest breath of air turns it back on the hand from
which it is thrown. We can hardly consider this as the perfection
of the female character!</p>

<p class='c014'>I must say I like Mrs. Radcliffe’s romances better, and think of
them oftener;—and even when I do not, part of the impression with
which I survey the full-orbed moon shining in the blue expanse of
heaven, or hear the wind sighing through autumnal leaves, or walk
under the echoing archways of a Gothic ruin, is owing to a repeated
perusal of the Romance of the Forest and the Mysteries of Udolpho.
Her descriptions of scenery, indeed, are vague and wordy to the last
degree; they are neither like Salvator nor Claude, nor nature nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>art; and she dwells on the effects of moonlight till we are sometimes
weary of them: her characters are insipid, the shadows of a shade,
continued on, under different names, through all her novels: her
story comes to nothing. But in harrowing up the soul with imaginary
horrors, and making the flesh creep, and the nerves thrill, with fond
hopes and fears, she is unrivalled among her fair country-women.
Her great power lies in describing the indefinable, and embodying a
phantom. She makes her readers twice children: and from the dim
and shadowy veil which she draws over the objects of her fancy,
forces us to believe all that is strange, and next to impossible, of their
mysterious agency:—whether it is the sound of the lover’s lute borne
o’er the distant waters along the winding shores of Provence, recalling,
with its magic breath, some long-lost friendship, or some hopeless
love; or the full choir of the cloistered monks, chaunting their midnight
orgies, or the lonely voice of an unhappy sister in her pensive
cell, like angels’ whispered music; or the deep sigh that steals from
a dungeon on the startled ear; or the dim apparition of ghastly
features; or the face of an assassin hid beneath a monk’s cowl;
or the robber gliding through the twilight gloom of the forest. All
the fascination that links the world of passion to the world unknown,
is hers, and she plays with it at her pleasure: she has all the poetry
of romance, all that is obscure, visionary, and objectless, in the
imagination. It seems that the simple notes of Clara’s lute, which so
delighted her youthful heart, still echo among the rocks and mountains
of the Valois; the mellow tones of the minstrel’s songs still mingle
with the noise of the dashing oar, and the rippling of the silver waves
of the Mediterranean; the voice of Agnes is heard from the haunted
tower; and Schedoni’s form still stalks through the frowning ruins
of Palinzi. The greatest treat, however, which Mrs. Radcliffe’s
pen has provided for the lovers of the marvellous and terrible, is the
Provençal tale which Ludovico reads in the Castle of Udolpho, as
the lights are beginning to burn blue, and just before the faces appear
from behind the tapestry that carry him off, and we hear no more of
him. This tale is of a knight, who being engaged in a dance at some
high festival of old romance, was summoned out by another knight
clad in complete steel; and being solemnly adjured to follow him
into the mazes of the neighbouring wood, his conductor brought him
at length to a hollow glade in the thickest part, where he pointed to
the murdered corse of another knight, and lifting up his beaver,
shewed him by the gleam of moonlight which fell on it, that it had
the face of his spectre-guide! The dramatic power in the character
of Schedoni, the Italian monk, has been much admired and praised;
but the effect does not depend upon the character, but the situations;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>not upon the figure, but upon the back-ground.—The Castle of
Otranto (which is supposed to have led the way to this style of
writing) is, to my notion, dry, meagre, and without effect. It is
done upon false principles of taste. The great hand and arm, which
are thrust into the court-yard, and remain there all day long, are the
pasteboard machinery of a pantomime; they shock the senses, and
have no purchase upon the imagination. They are a matter-of-fact
impossibility; a fixture, and no longer a phantom. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod sic mihi
ostendis, incredulus odi.</span></i> By realising the chimeras of ignorance and
fear, begot upon shadows and dim likenesses, we take away the very
grounds of credulity and superstition; and, as in other cases, by facing
out the imposture, betray the secret to the contempt and laughter of
the spectators. The Recess and the Old English Baron are also
‘dismal treatises,’ but with little in them ‘at which our fell of hair
is likely to rouse and stir as life were in it.’ They are dull and
prosing, without the spirit of fiction, or the air of tradition to make
them interesting. After Mrs. Radcliffe, Monk Lewis was the
greatest master of the art of freezing the blood. The robber-scene
in the Monk is only inferior to that in Count Fathom, and perfectly
new in the circumstances and cast of the characters. Some of his
descriptions are chargeable with unpardonable grossness, but the
pieces of poetry interspersed in this far-famed novel, such as the
fight of Ronscevalles and the Exile, in particular, have a romantic
and delightful harmony, such as might be chaunted by the moonlight
pilgrim, or might lull the dreaming mariner on summer-seas.</p>

<p class='c014'>If Mrs. Radcliffe touched the trembling chords of the imagination,
making wild music there, Mrs. Inchbald has no less power over the
springs of the heart. She not only moves the affections, but melts us
into ‘all the luxury of woe.’ Her ‘Nature and Art’ is one of the
most pathetic and interesting stories in the world. It is, indeed, too
much so; or the distress is too naked, and the situations hardly to
be borne with patience. I think nothing, however, can exceed in
delicacy and beauty the account of the love-letter which the poor
girl, who is the subject of the story, receives from her lover, and
which she is a fortnight in spelling out, sooner than shew it to
any one else; nor the dreadful catastrophe of the last fatal scene,
in which the same poor creature, as her former seducer, now become
her judge, is about to pronounce sentence of death upon her, cries
out in agony—‘Oh, not from you!’ The effect of this novel upon
the feelings, is not only of the most distressing, but withering kind.
It blights the sentiments, and haunts the memory. The Simple
Story is not much better in this respect: the gloom, however, which
hangs over it, is of a more fixed and tender kind: we are not now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>lifted to ecstacy, only to be plunged in madness; and besides the
sweetness and dignity of some of the characters, there are redeeming
traits, retrospective glances on the course of human life, which
brighten the backward stream, and smile in hope or patience to the
last. Such is the account of Sandford, her stern and inflexible
adviser, sitting by the bedside of Miss Miller, and comforting her in
her dying moments; thus softening the worst pang of human nature,
and reconciling us to the best, but not most shining virtues in human
character. The conclusion of Nature and Art, on the contrary, is a
scene of heartless desolation, which must effectually deter any one
from ever reading the book twice. Mrs. Inchbald is an instance to
confute the assertion of Rousseau, that women fail whenever they
attempt to describe the passion of love.</p>

<p class='c014'>I shall conclude this Lecture, by saying a few words of the author
of Caleb Williams, and the author of Waverley. I shall speak of
the last first. In knowledge, in variety, in facility, in truth of
painting, in costume and scenery, in freshness of subject and in untired
interest, in glancing lights and the graces of a style passing at will
from grave to gay, from lively to severe, at once romantic and
familiar, having the utmost force of imitation and apparent freedom
of invention; these novels have the highest claims to admiration.
What lack they yet? The author has all power given him from
without—he has not, perhaps, an equal power from within. The
intensity of the feeling is not equal to the distinctness of the imagery.
He sits like a magician in his cell, and conjures up all shapes and
sights to the view; and with a little variation we might apply to him
what Spenser says of Fancy:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His chamber was dispainted all within</div>
      <div class='line'>With sundry colours, in the which were writ</div>
      <div class='line'>Infinite shapes of things dispersed thin;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some such as in the world were never yet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Some daily seen and knowen by their names,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such as in idle fantasies do flit;</div>
      <div class='line'>Infernal hags, centaurs, fiends, hippodames,</div>
      <div class='line'>Apes, lions, eagles, owls, fools, lovers, children, dames.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the midst of all this phantasmagoria, the author himself never
appears to take part with his characters, to prompt our affection to
the good, or sharpen our antipathy to the bad. It is the perfection
of art to conceal art; and this is here done so completely, that while
it adds to our pleasure in the work, it seems to take away from the
merit of the author. As he does not thrust himself forward in
the foreground, he loses the credit of the performance. The
copies are so true to nature, that they appear like tapestry figures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>taken off by the pattern; the obvious patchwork of tradition and
history. His characters are transplanted at once from their native
soil to the page which we are reading, without any traces of their
having passed through the hot-bed of the author’s genius or vanity.
He leaves them as he found them; but this is doing wonders. The
Laird and the Baillie of Bradwardine, the idiot rhymer David
Gellatly, Miss Rose Bradwardine, and Miss Flora Mac Ivor, her
brother the Highland Jacobite chieftain, Vich Ian Vohr, the Highland
rover, Donald Bean Lean, and the worthy page Callum Beg,
Bothwell, and Balfour of Burley, Claverhouse and Macbriar, Elshie,
the Black Dwarf, and the Red Reever of Westburn Flat, Hobbie
and Grace Armstrong, Ellen Gowan and Dominie Sampson, Dirk
Hatteraick and Meg Merrilees, are at present ‘familiar in our mouths
as household names,’ and whether they are actual persons or creations
of the poet’s pen, is an impertinent inquiry. The picturesque and
local scenery is as fresh as the lichen on the rock: the characters are
a part of the scenery. If they are put in action, it is a moving
picture: if they speak, we hear their dialect and the tones of their
voice. If the humour is made out by dialect, the character by the
dress, the interest by the facts and documents in the author’s possession,
we have no right to complain, if it is made out; but sometimes
it hardly is, and then we have a right to say so. For instance, in the
Tales of my Landlord, Canny Elshie is not in himself so formidable
or petrific a person as the real Black Dwarf, called David Ritchie,
nor are his acts or sayings so staggering to the imagination. Again,
the first introduction of this extraordinary personage, groping about
among the hoary twilight ruins of the Witch of Micklestane Moor
and her Grey Geese, is as full of preternatural power and bewildering
effect (according to the tradition of the country) as can be; while
the last decisive scene, where the Dwarf, in his resumed character of
Sir Edward Mauley, comes from the tomb in the chapel, to prevent
the forced marriage of the daughter of his former betrothed mistress
with the man she abhors, is altogether powerless and tame. No
situation could be imagined more finely calculated to call forth an
author’s powers of imagination and passion; but nothing is done.
The assembly is dispersed under circumstances of the strongest natural
feeling, and the most appalling preternatural appearances, just as if the
effect had been produced by a peace-officer entering for the same
purpose. These instances of a falling off are, however, rare; and if
this author should not be supposed by fastidious critics to have original
genius in the highest degree, he has other qualities which supply its
place so well, his materials are so rich and varied, and he uses them
so lavishly, that the reader is no loser by the exchange. We are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>in fear that he should publish another novel; we are under no
apprehension of his exhausting himself, for he has shewn that he is
inexhaustible.</p>

<p class='c014'>Whoever else is, it is pretty clear that the author of Caleb Williams
and St. Leon is not the author of Waverley. Nothing can be more
distinct or excellent in their several ways than these two writers. If
the one owes almost every thing to external observation and traditional
character, the other owes every thing to internal conception and contemplation
of the possible workings of the human mind. There is
little knowledge of the world, little variety, neither an eye for the
picturesque, nor a talent for the humorous in Caleb Williams, for
instance, but you cannot doubt for a moment of the originality of the
work and the force of the conception. The impression made upon
the reader is the exact measure of the strength of the author’s genius.
For the effect, both in Caleb Williams and St. Leon, is entirely
made out, neither by facts, nor dates, by black-letter or magazine
learning, by transcript nor record, but by intense and patient study of
the human heart, and by an imagination projecting itself into certain
situations, and capable of working up its imaginary feelings to the
height of reality. The author launches into the ideal world, and
must sustain himself and the reader there by the mere force of
imagination. The sense of power in the writer thus adds to the
interest of the subject.—The character of Falkland is a sort of
apotheosis of the love of fame. The gay, the gallant Falkland lives
only in the good opinion of good men; for this he adorns his soul
with virtue, and tarnishes it with crime; he lives only for this, and
dies as he loses it. He is a lover of virtue, but a worshipper of
fame. Stung to madness by a brutal insult, he avenges himself by a
crime of the deepest die, and the remorse of his conscience and the
stain upon his honour prey upon his peace and reason ever after. It
was into the mouth of such a character that a modern poet has well
put the words,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>‘——Action is momentary,</div>
      <div class='line'>The motion of a muscle, this way or that;</div>
      <div class='line'>Suffering is long, obscure, and infinite.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In the conflict of his feelings, he is worn to a skeleton, wasted to a
shadow. But he endures this living death to watch over his undying
reputation, and to preserve his name unsullied and free from suspicion.
But he is at last disappointed in this his darling object, by the very
means he takes to secure it, and by harassing and goading Caleb
Williams (whose insatiable, incessant curiosity had wormed itself into
his confidence) to a state of desperation, by employing every sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>persecution, and by trying to hunt him from society like an infection,
makes him turn upon him, and betray the inmost secret of his soul.
The last moments of Falkland are indeed sublime: the spark of life
and the hope of imperishable renown are extinguished in him together;
and bending his last look of forgiveness on his victim and destroyer,
he dies a martyr to fame, but a confessor at the shrine of virtue!
The re-action and play of these two characters into each other’s hands
(like Othello and Iago) is inimitably well managed, and on a par
with any thing in the dramatic art; but Falkland is the hero of the
story, Caleb Williams is only the instrument of it. This novel is
utterly unlike any thing else that ever was written, and is one of the
most original as well as powerful productions in the English language.—St.
Leon is not equal to it in the plot and ground-work, though
perhaps superior in the execution. In the one Mr. Godwin has hit
upon the extreme point of the perfectly natural and perfectly new;
in the other he ventures into the preternatural world, and comes
nearer to the world of common place. Still the character is of the
same exalted intellectual kind. As the ruling passion of the one was
the love of fame, so in the other the sole business of life is thought.
Raised by the fatal discovery of the philosopher’s stone above
mortality, he is cut off from all participation with its pleasures. He
is a limb torn from society. In possession of eternal youth and
beauty, he can feel no love; surrounded, tantalized, tormented with
riches, he can do no good. The races of men pass before him as in
a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">speculum</span></i>; but he is attached to them by no common tie of sympathy
or suffering. He is thrown back into himself and his own
thoughts. He lives in the solitude of his own breast,—without wife
or child, or friend, or enemy in the world. His is the solitude of the
soul,—not of woods, or seas, or mountains,—but the desart of society,
the waste and desolation of the heart. He is himself alone. His
existence is purely contemplative, and is therefore intolerable to one
who has felt the rapture of affection or the anguish of woe. The
contrast between the enthusiastic eagerness of human pursuits and
their blank disappointment, was never, perhaps, more finely pourtrayed
than in this novel. Marguerite, the wife of St. Leon, is an
instance of pure and disinterested affection in one of the noblest of
her sex. It is not improbable that the author found the model of this
character in nature.—Of Mandeville, I shall say only one word. It
appears to me to be a falling off in the subject, not in the ability.
The style and declamation are even more powerful than ever. But
unless an author surpasses himself, and surprises the public as much
the fourth or fifth time as he did the first, he is said to fall off,
because there is not the same stimulus of novelty. A great deal is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>here made out of nothing, or out of a very disagreeable subject. I
cannot agree that the story is out of nature. The feeling is very
common indeed; though carried to an unusual and improbable excess,
or to one with which from the individuality and minuteness of the
circumstances, we cannot readily sympathise.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is rare that a philosopher is a writer of romances. The union
of the two characters in this author is a sort of phenomenon in the
history of letters; for I cannot but consider the author of Political
Justice as a philosophical reasoner of no ordinary stamp or pretensions.
That work, whatever its defects may be, is distinguished by the most
acute and severe logic, and by the utmost boldness of thinking,
founded on a love and conviction of truth. It is a system of ethics,
and one that, though I think it erroneous myself, is built on following
up into its fair consequences, a very common and acknowledged
principle, that abstract reason and general utility are the only test and
standard of moral rectitude. If this principle is true, then the system
is true: but I think that Mr. Godwin’s book has done more than
any thing else to overturn the sufficiency of this principle by abstracting,
in a strict metaphysical process, the influence of reason or the
understanding in moral questions and relations from that of habit,
sense, association, local and personal attachment, natural affection,
&amp;c.; and by thus making it appear how necessary the latter are to
our limited, imperfect, and mixed being, how impossible the former
as an exclusive guide of action, unless man were, or were capable of
becoming, a purely intellectual being. Reason is no doubt one faculty
of the human mind, and the chief gift of Providence to man; but it
must itself be subject to and modified by other instincts and principles,
because it is not the only one. This work then, even supposing it to
be false, is invaluable as demonstrating an important truth by the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</span></i>; or it is an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</span></i> in one of the
grand and trying questions of moral philosophy.—In delineating
the character and feelings of the hermetic philosopher St. Leon,
perhaps the author had not far to go from those of a speculative
philosophical Recluse. He who deals in the secrets of magic, or in
the secrets of the human mind, is too often looked upon with jealous
eyes by the world, which is no great conjuror; he who pours out his
intellectual wealth into the lap of the public, is hated by those who
cannot understand how he came by it; he who thinks beyond his
age, cannot expect the feelings of his contemporaries to go along with
him; he whose mind is of no age or country, is seldom properly
recognised during his life-time, and must wait, in order to have justice
done him, for the late but lasting award of posterity:—‘Where his
treasure is, there his heart is also.’</p>

<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE VII<br /> <span class='c013'>ON THE WORKS OF HOGARTH.—ON THE GRAND AND FAMILIAR STYLE OF PAINTING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>If the quantity of amusement, or of matter for more serious reflection
which their works have afforded, is that by which we are to judge of
precedence among the intellectual benefactors of mankind, there are,
perhaps, few persons who can put in a stronger claim to our gratitude
than Hogarth. It is not hazarding too much to assert, that he was
one of the greatest comic geniuses that ever lived, and he was certainly
one of the most extraordinary men this country has produced. The
wonderful knowledge which he possessed of human life and manners,
is only to be surpassed (if it can be) by the power of invention with
which he has combined and contrasted his materials in the most
ludicrous and varied points of view, and by the mastery of execution
with which he has embodied and made tangible the very thoughts
and passing movements of the mind. Critics sometimes object to the
style of Hogarth’s pictures, or to the class to which they belong.
First, he belongs to no class, or if he does, it is to the same class as
Fielding, Smollett, Vanbrugh, and Moliere. Besides, the merit of
his pictures does not depend on the nature of the subject, but on the
knowledge displayed of it, on the number of ideas they excite, on the
fund of thought and observation contained in them. They are to be
studied as works of science as well as of amusement; they satisfy
our love of truth; they fill up the void in the mind; they form a
series of plates in natural history, and of that most interesting
part of natural history, the history of our own species. Make
what deductions you please for the vulgarity of the subject, yet
in the research, the profundity, the absolute truth and precision
of the delineation of character; in the invention of incident, in wit
and humour; in the life with which they are ‘instinct in every part;’
in everlasting variety and originality; they never have, and probably
never will be surpassed. They stimulate the faculties as well as
soothe them. ‘Other pictures we see, Hogarth’s we read.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The public had not long ago an opportunity of viewing most of
Hogarth’s pictures, in the collection made of them at the British
Gallery. The superiority of the original paintings to the common
prints, is in a great measure confined to the Marriage a-la-Mode, with
which I shall begin my remarks.</p>

<p class='c014'>Boccaccio, the most refined and sentimental of all the novel-writers,
has been stigmatised as a mere inventor of licentious tales, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>readers in general have only seized on those things in his works which
were suited to their own taste, and have thus reflected their own grossness
back upon the writer. So it has happened, that the majority of
critics having been most struck with the strong and decided expression
in Hogarth, the extreme delicacy and subtle gradations of character
in his pictures have almost entirely escaped them. In the
first picture of the <i>Marriage a-la-Mode</i>, the three figures of the
young Nobleman, his intended Bride, and her Inamorato, the
Lawyer, shew how much Hogarth excelled in the power of giving
soft and effeminate expression. They have, however, been less
noticed than the other figures, which tell a plainer story, and convey
a more palpable moral. Nothing can be more finely managed than
the differences of character in these delicate personages. The beau
sits smiling at the looking-glass with a reflected simper of self-admiration,
and a languishing inclination of the head, while the rest
of his body is perked up on his high heels with a certain air of
tip-toe elevation. He is the Narcissus of the reign of George II.;
whose powdered peruke, ruffles, gold-lace, and patches, divide his self-love
unequally with his own person—the true <i>Sir Plume</i> of his day;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Of amber-lidded snuff box justly vain,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the nice conduct of a clouded cane.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Again we find the same felicity in the figure and attitude of the
Bride, courted by the Lawyer. There is the utmost flexibility, and
yielding softness in her whole person, a listless languor and tremulous
suspense in the expression of her face. It is the precise look and air
which Pope has given to his favourite Belinda, just at the moment of
the <i>Rape of the Lock</i>. The heightened glow, the forward intelligence,
and loosened soul of love in the same face, in the Assignation
scene before the masquerade, form a fine and instructive contrast to
the delicacy, timidity, and coy reluctance expressed in the first.
The Lawyer in both pictures is much the same, perhaps too much
so; though even this unmoved, unaltered appearance may be designed
as characteristic. In both cases he has ‘a person, and a smooth
dispose, framed to make women false.’ He is full of that easy good-humour,
and easy good opinion of himself, with which the sex are
often delighted. There is not a sharp angle in his face to obstruct
his success, or give a hint of doubt or difficulty. His whole aspect
is round and rosy, lively and unmeaning, happy without the least
expense of thought, careless and inviting; and conveys a perfect idea
of the uninterrupted glide and pleasing murmur of the soft periods
that flow from his tongue.</p>

<p class='c014'>The expression of the Bride in the Morning Scene is the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>highly seasoned, and at the same time the most vulgar in the series.
The figure, face, and attitude of the husband, are inimitable.
Hogarth has with great skill contrasted the pale countenance of
the husband with the yellow whitish colour of the marble chimneypiece
behind him, in such a manner as to preserve the fleshy tone of
the former. The airy splendour of the view of the inner-room in
this picture is probably not exceeded by any of the productions of
the Flemish school.</p>

<p class='c014'>The young girl in the third picture, who is represented as the
victim of fashionable profligacy, is unquestionably one of the artist’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvres</span></i>. The exquisite delicacy of the painting is only surpassed
by the felicity and subtlety of the conception. Nothing can
be more striking than the contrast between the extreme softness of
her person, and the hardened indifference of her character. The
vacant stillness, the docility to vice, the premature suppression of
youthful sensibility, the doll-like mechanism of the whole figure,
which seems to have no other feeling but a sickly sense of pain—shew
the deepest insight into human nature, and into the effects of
those refinements in depravity, by which it has been good-naturedly
asserted, that ‘vice loses half its evil in losing all its grossness.’ The
story of this picture is in some parts very obscure and enigmatical.
It is certain that the nobleman is not looking strait forward to the
quack, whom he seems to have been threatening with his cane; but
that his eyes are turned up with an ironical leer of triumph to the
procuress. The commanding attitude and size of this woman, the
swelling circumference of her dress, spread out like a turkey-cock’s
feathers, the fierce, ungovernable, inveterate malignity of her countenance,
which hardly needs the comment of the clasp-knife to explain
her purpose, all are admirable in themselves, and still more so, as they
are opposed to the mute insensibility, the elegant negligence of dress,
and the childish figure of the girl who is supposed to be her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i><a id='t135'></a>.—As
for the Quack, there can be no doubt entertained about him.
His face seems as if it were composed of salve, and his features
exhibit all the chaos or confusion of the most gross, ignorant, and impudent
empiricism. The gradations of ridiculous affectation in the
Music scene are finely imagined and preserved. The preposterous,
overstrained admiration of the lady of quality; the sentimental,
insipid, patient delight of the man, with his hair in papers, and
sipping his tea: the pert, smirking, conceited, half-distorted approbation
of the figure next to him; the transition to the total insensibility
of the round face in profile, and then to the wonder of the negro-boy
at the rapture of his mistress, form a perfect whole. The sanguine
complexion and flame-coloured hair of the female virtuoso throw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>an additional light on the character. This is lost in the print. The
continuing the red colour of the hair into the back of the chair, has
been pointed out as one of those instances of what may be termed
alliteration in colouring, of which these pictures are every where full.
The gross bloated appearance of the Italian singer is well relieved by
the hard features of the instrumental performer behind him, which
might be carved of wood. The negro-boy holding the chocolate,
both in expression, colour, and execution, is a masterpiece. The
gay, lively derision of the other negro-boy playing with the Acteon,
is an ingenious contrast to the profound amazement of the first.
Some account has already been given of the two lovers in this
picture. It is curious to observe the infinite activity of mind which
the artist displays on every occasion. An instance occurs in the
present picture. He has so contrived the papers in the hair of the
bride, as to make them look almost like a wreath of half-blown
flowers; while those which he has placed on the head of the musical
amateur, very much resemble a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-fris</span></i> of horns, which adorn
and fortify the lack lustre expression, and mild resignation of the face
beneath.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Night Scene is inferior to the rest of the series. The
attitude of the husband, who is just killed, is one in which it
would be impossible for him to stand or even to fall. It resembles
the loose pasteboard figures they make for children. The characters
in the last picture, in which the wife dies, are all masterly. I would
particularly refer to the captious, petulant, self-sufficiency of the
Apothecary, whose face and figure are constructed on exact
physiognomical principles; and to the fine example of passive
obedience and non-resistance in the servant, whom he is taking to
task, and whose coat, of green and yellow livery, is as long and as
melancholy as his face. The disconsolate look and haggard eyes,
the open mouth, the comb sticking in the hair, the broken gapped
teeth, which, as it were, hitch in an answer, every thing about him
denotes the utmost perplexity and dismay. The harmony and
gradations of colour in this picture are uniformly preserved with
the greatest nicety, and are well worthy the attention of the artist.—I
have so far attempted to point out the fund of observation, physical
and moral, contained in one set of these pictures, the <i>Marriage-a-la-Mode</i>.
The rest would furnish as many topics to descant upon, were
the patience of the reader as inexhaustible as the painter’s invention.
But as this is not the case, I shall content myself with barely referring
to some of those figures in the other pictures, which appear to me the
most striking, and which we see not only while we are looking at
them, but which we have before us at all other times. For instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>who, having seen, can easily forget that exquisite frost-piece of
religion and morality, the antiquated Prude in the Morning Scene;
or that striking commentary on the <i>good old times</i>, the little wretched
appendage of a Foot-boy, who crawls, half famished and half frozen,
behind her? The French man and woman in the Noon, are the
perfection of flighty affectation and studied grimace; the amiable
<i>fraternization</i> of the two old women saluting each other, is not enough
to be admired; and in the little Master, in the same national group,
we see the early promise and personification of that eternal principle
of wondrous self-complacency, proof against all circumstances, and
which makes the French the only people who are vain even of being
cuckolded and being conquered! Or shall we prefer to this the
outraged distress and unmitigated terrors of the Boy who has
dropped his dish of meat, and who seems red all over with shame
and vexation, and bursting with the noise he makes? Or what
can be better than the good housewifery of the Girl underneath,
who is devouring the lucky fragments; or than the plump, ripe,
florid, luscious look of the Servant-wench near her, embraced by
a greasy rascal of an Othello, with her pye-dish tottering like her
virtue, and with the most precious part of its contents running over?
Just—no, not quite—as good is the joke of the Woman overhead,
who, having quarrelled with her Husband, is throwing their Sunday’s
dinner out of the window, to complete this chapter of accidents of
baked-dishes. The Husband in the Evening Scene is certainly as
meek as any recorded in history; but I cannot say that I admire
this picture, or the Night Scene after it. But then, in the Taste in
High-Life, there is that inimitable pair, differing only in sex,
congratulating and delighting one another by ‘all the mutually
reflected charities’ of folly and affectation, with the young Lady,
coloured like a rose, dandling her little, black, pug-faced, white-teethed,
chuckling favourite; and with the portrait of Monsieur Des
Noyers in the back-ground, dancing in a grand ballet, surrounded by
butterflies. And again, in the Election Dinner, is the immortal
Cobbler, surrounded by his Peers, who,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——frequent and full,</div>
      <div class='line'>In <i>loud</i> recess and <i>brawling</i> conclave sit’——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>the Jew in the second picture, a very Jew in grain; innumerable fine
sketches of heads in the Polling for Votes, of which the Nobleman
overlooking the Caricaturist is the second best, and the Blind-man
going up to vote, the best; and then the irresistible, tumultuous
display of broad humour in the Chairing the Member, which is,
perhaps, of all Hogarth’s pictures, the most full of laughable incidents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>and situations; the yellow, rusty-faced Thresher, with his swinging
flail breaking the head of one of the chairmen; and his redoubted
antagonist, the Sailor, with his oak-stick, and stumping wooden-leg,
a supplemental cudgel; the persevering ecstasy of the hobbling
Blind Fiddler, who, in the fray, appears to have been trod upon by
the artificial excrescence of the honest tar; Monsieur, the monkey,
with piteous aspect, speculating the impending disaster of the
triumphant Candidate, and his brother Bruin, appropriating the
paunch; the precipitous flight of the Pigs, souse over head into
the water; the fine Lady fainting, with vermilion lips; and the two
Chimney Sweepers, satirical young rogues!—I had almost forgot the
Politician, who is burning a hole through his hat with a candle in
reading a newspaper; and the Chickens, in the <i>March to Finchley</i>,
wandering in search of their lost dam, who is found in the pocket of
the Serjeant. Of the pictures in the <i>Rake’s Progress</i>, exhibited in
this collection, I shall not here say any thing, because I think them
on the whole inferior to the prints, and because they have already
been criticised by a writer, to whom I could add nothing, in a paper
which ought to be read by every lover of Hogarth and of English
genius—I mean, Mr. Lamb’s Essay on the works of Hogarth. I
shall at present proceed to form some estimate of the style of art in
which this painter excelled.</p>

<p class='c014'>What distinguishes his compositions from all others of the same
general kind, is, that they are equally remote from caricature, and
from mere still life. It of course happens in subjects taken from
common life, that the painter can procure real models, and he can
get them to sit as long as he pleases. Hence, in general, those
attitudes and expressions have been chosen which could be assumed
the longest; and in imitating which, the artist by taking pains
and time might produce almost as complete <i>fac-similes</i> as he could of
a flower or a flower-pot, of a damask curtain or a china-vase. The
copy was as perfect and as uninteresting in the one case as in
the other. On the contrary, subjects of drollery and ridicule affording
frequent examples of strange deformity and peculiarity of features,
these have been eagerly seized by another class of artists, who,
without subjecting themselves to the laborious drudgery of the Dutch
school and their imitators, have produced our popular caricatures, by
rudely copying or exaggerating the casual irregularities of the human
countenance. Hogarth has equally avoided the faults of both these
styles: the insipid tameness of the one, and the gross extravagance
of the other, so as to give to the productions of his pencil equal
solidity and effect. For his faces go to the very verge of caricature,
and yet never (I believe in any single instance) go beyond it: they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>take the very widest latitude, and yet we always see the links which
bind them to nature: they bear all the marks, and carry all the conviction
of reality with them, as if we had seen the actual faces for
the first time, from the precision, consistency, and good sense with
which the whole and every part is made out. They exhibit the
most uncommon features, with the most uncommon expressions:
but which yet are as familiar and intelligible as possible, because with
all the boldness, they have all the truth of nature. Hogarth has left
behind him as many of these memorable faces, in their memorable
moments, as, perhaps, most of us remember in the course of our
lives, and has thus doubled the quantity of our experience.</p>

<p class='c014'>It will assist us in forming a more determinate idea of the peculiar
genius of Hogarth, to compare him with a deservedly admired artist
in our own times. The highest authority on art in this country, I
understand, has pronounced that Mr. Wilkie united the excellences
of Hogarth to those of Teniers. I demur to this decision in both
its branches; but in demurring to authority, it is necessary to give
our reasons. I conceive that this ingenious and attentive observer
of nature has certain essential, real, and indisputable excellences of
his own; and I think it, therefore, the less important to clothe him
with any vicarious merits which do not belong to him. Mr. Wilkie’s
pictures, generally speaking, derive almost their whole value from
their <i>reality</i>, or the truth of the representation. They are works of
pure imitative art; and the test of this style of composition is to
represent nature faithfully and happily in its simplest combinations.
It may be said of an artist like Mr. Wilkie, that <i>nothing human is indifferent
to him</i>. His mind takes an interest in, and it gives an
interest to, the most familiar scenes and transactions of life. He
professedly gives character, thought, and passion, in their lowest
degrees, and in their every-day forms. He selects the commonest
events and appearances of nature for his subjects; and trusts to their
very commonness for the interest and amusement he is to excite.
Mr. Wilkie is a serious, prosaic, literal narrator of facts; and his
pictures may be considered as diaries, or minutes of what is passing
constantly about us. Hogarth, on the contrary, is essentially a
comic painter; his pictures are not indifferent, unimpassioned descriptions
of human nature, but rich, exuberant satires upon it. He
is carried away by a passion for the <i>ridiculous</i>. His object is ‘to
shew vice her own feature, scorn her own image.’ He is so far from
contenting himself with still-life, that he is always on the verge of
caricature, though without ever falling into it. He does not represent
folly or vice in its incipient, or dormant, or <i>grub</i> state; but
full grown, with wings, pampered into all sorts of affectation, airy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>ostentatious, and extravagant. Folly is there seen at the height—the
moon is at the full; it is ‘the very error of the time.’ There
is a perpetual collision of eccentricities—a tilt and tournament of
absurdities; the prejudices and caprices of mankind are let loose,
and set together by the ears, as in a bear-garden. Hogarth paints
nothing but comedy, or tragi-comedy. Wilkie paints neither one
nor the other. Hogarth never looks at any object but to find out a
moral or a ludicrous effect. Wilkie never looks at any object but
to see that it is there. Hogarth’s pictures are a perfect jest-book,
from one end to the other. I do not remember a single joke in
Wilkie’s, except one very bad one of the boy in the Blind Fiddler,
scraping the gridiron, or fire-shovel, I forget which it is.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c015'><sup>[23]</sup></a> In looking
at Hogarth, you are ready to burst your sides with laughing at
the unaccountable jumble of odd things which are brought together;
you look at Wilkie’s pictures with a mingled feeling of curiosity, and
admiration at the accuracy of the representation. For instance,
there is a most admirable head of a man coughing in the Rent-day;
the action, the keeping, the choaked sensation, are inimitable: but
there is nothing to laugh at in a man coughing. What strikes the
mind is the difficulty of a man’s being painted coughing, which here
certainly is a masterpiece of art. But turn to the blackguard Cobbler
in the Election Dinner, who has been smutting his neighbour’s face
over, and who is lolling out his tongue at the joke, with a most
surprising obliquity of vision; and immediately ‘your lungs begin to
crow like chanticleer.’ Again, there is the little boy crying in the
Cut Finger, who only gives you the idea of a cross, disagreeable,
obstinate child in pain: whereas the same face in Hogarth’s Noon,
from the ridiculous perplexity it is in, and its extravagant, noisy,
unfelt distress, at the accident of having let fall the pye-dish, is quite
irresistible. Mr. Wilkie, in his picture of the Ale-house door, I
believe, painted Mr. Liston as one of the figures, without any great
effect. Hogarth would have given any price for such a subject, and
would have made it worth any money. I have never seen any thing,
in the expression of comic humour, equal to Hogarth’s pictures, but
Liston’s face!</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Wilkie paints interiors: but still you generally connect them
with the country. Hogarth, even when he paints people in the open
air, represents them either as coming from London, as in the polling
for votes at Brentford, or as returning to it, as the dyer and his wife
at Bagnigge Wells. In this last picture, he has contrived to convert
a common rural image into a type and emblem of city honours. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>fact, I know no one who had a less pastoral imagination than
Hogarth. He delights in the thick of St. Giles’s or St. James’s.
His pictures breathe a certain close, greasy, tavern air. The fare
he serves up to us consists of high-seasoned dishes, ragouts and <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">olla
podridas</span>, like the supper in Gil Blas, which it requires a strong
stomach to digest. Mr. Wilkie presents us with a sort of lenten
fare, very good and wholesome, but rather insipid than overpowering!
Mr. Wilkie’s pictures are, in general, much better painted than
Hogarth’s; but the Marriage-a-la-Mode is superior both in colour
and execution to any of Wilkie’s. I may add here, without any disparagement,
that, as an artist, Mr. Wilkie is hardly to be mentioned
with Teniers. Neither in truth and brilliant clearness of colouring,
nor in facility of execution, is there any comparison. Teniers was
a perfect master in all these respects; and our own countryman is
positively defective, notwithstanding the very laudable care with
which he finishes every part of his pictures. There is an evident
smear and dragging of the paint, which is also of a bad purple, or
puttyish tone, and which never appears in the pictures of the Flemish
artist, any more than in a looking-glass. Teniers, probably from his
facility of execution, succeeded in giving a more local and momentary
expression to his figures. They seem each going on with his
particular amusement or occupation; Wilkie’s have, in general, more
a look of sitting for their pictures. Their compositions are very
different also: and in this respect, I believe, Mr. Wilkie has the
advantage. Teniers’s boors are usually amusing themselves at skittles,
or dancing, or drinking, or smoking, or doing what they like, in a
careless, desultory way; and so the composition is loose and irregular.
Wilkie’s figures are all drawn up in a regular order, and engaged in
one principal action, with occasional episodes. The story of the
Blind Fiddler is the most interesting, and the best told. The two
children standing before the musician are delightful. The Card-players
is the best coloured of his pictures, if I am not mistaken.
The Village Politicians, though excellent as to character and composition,
is inferior as a picture to those which Mr. Wilkie has since
painted. His latest pictures, however, do not appear to me to be his
best. There is something of manner and affectation in the grouping
of the figures, and a pink and rosy colour spread over them, which
is out of place. The hues of Rubens and Sir Joshua do not agree
with Mr. Wilkie’s subjects. One of his last pictures, that of
Duncan Gray, is equally remarkable for sweetness and simplicity
in colour, composition, and expression. I must here conclude this
very general account; for to point out the particular beauties of every
one of his pictures in detail, would require an Essay by itself.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>I have promised to say something in this Lecture on the difference
between the grand and familiar style of painting; and I shall throw
out what imperfect hints I have been able to collect on this subject,
so often attempted, and never yet succeeded in, taking the examples
and illustrations from Hogarth, that is, from what he possessed or
wanted in each kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>And first, the difference is not that between imitation and invention:
for there is as much of this last quality in Hogarth, as in any
painter or poet whatever. As, for example, to take two of his
pictures only, I mean the Enraged Musician and the Gin Lane;—in
one of which every conceivable variety of disagreeable and discordant
sound—the razor-grinder turning his wheel; the boy with
his drum, and the girl with her rattle momentarily suspended; the
pursuivant blowing his horn; the shrill milkwoman; the inexorable
ballad-singer, with her squalling infant; the pewterer’s shop close by;
the fishwomen; the chimney-sweepers at the top of a chimney, and
the two cats in melodious concert on the ridge of the tiles; with
the bells ringing in the distance, as we see by the flags flying:—and
in the other, the complicated forms and signs of death and ruinous
decay—the woman on the stairs of the bridge asleep, letting her
child fall over; her ghastly companion opposite, next to death’s
door, with hollow, famished cheeks and staring ribs; the dog
fighting with the man for the bare shin-bone; the man hanging himself
in a garret; the female corpse put into a coffin by the parish
beadle; the men marching after a funeral, seen through a broken
wall in the back ground; and the very houses reeling as if drunk and
tumbling about the ears of the infatuated victims below, the pawnbroker’s
being the only one that stands firm and unimpaired—enforce
the moral meant to be conveyed by each of these pieces with a richness
and research of combination and artful contrast not easily paralleled
in any production of the pencil or the pen. The clock pointing
to four in the morning, in Modern Midnight Conversation, just as
the immoveable Parson Ford is filling out another glass from a
brimming punch-bowl, while most of his companions, with the exception
of the sly Lawyer, are falling around him ‘like leaves in
October;’ and again, the extraordinary mistake of the man leaning
against the post, in the Lord Mayor’s Procession—shew a mind
capable of seizing the most rare and transient coincidences of
things, of imagining what either never happened at all, or of
instantly fixing on and applying to its purpose what never happened
but once. So far, the invention shewn in the great style of
painting is poor in the comparison. Indeed, grandeur is supposed
(whether rightly or not, I shall not here inquire) to imply a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>simplicity inconsistent with this inexhaustible variety of incident and
circumstantial detail.</p>

<p class='c014'>Secondly, the difference between the ideal and familiar style is not
to be explained by the difference between the genteel and vulgar; for
it is evident that Hogarth was almost as much at home in the genteel
comedy, as in the broad farce of his pictures. He excelled not only
in exhibiting the coarse humours and disgusting incidents of low life,
but in exhibiting the vices, follies, and frivolity of the fashionable
manners of his time: his fine ladies hardly yield the palm to his
waiting-maids, and his lords and his footmen are on a respectable
footing of equality. There is no want, for example, in the Marriage-a-la-Mode,
or in Taste in High Life, of affectation verging into
idiotism, or of languid sensibility, that might—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Die of a rose in aromatic pain.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>In short, Hogarth was a painter, not of low but of actual life; and
the ridiculous and prominent features of high or low life, of the great
vulgar or the small, lay equally open to him. The Country Girl, in
the first plate of the Harlot’s Progress, coming out of the waggon, is
not more simple and ungainly, than the same figure, in the second, is
thoroughly initiated into the mysteries of her art, and suddenly
accomplished in all the airs and graces of affectation, ease, and
impudence. The affected languor and imbecility of the same girl
afterwards, when put to beat hemp in Bridewell, is exactly in keeping
with the character she has been taught to assume. Sir Joshua could
do nothing like it in his line of portrait, which differed chiefly in the
back ground. The fine gentleman at his levee, in the Rake’s
Progress, is also a complete model of a person of rank and fortune,
surrounded by needy and worthless adventurers, fiddlers, poetasters
and virtuosi, as was the custom in those days. Lord Chesterfield
himself would not have been disgraced by sitting for it. I might
multiply examples to shew that Hogarth was not characteristically
deficient in that kind of elegance which arises from an habitual
attention to external appearance and deportment. I will only add as
instances, among his women, the two <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élégantes</span></i><a id='t143'></a> in the Bedlam scene,
which are dressed (allowing for the difference of not quite a century)
in the manner of Ackerman’s dresses for May; and among the men, the
Lawyer in Modern Midnight Conversation, whose gracious significant
leer and sleek lubricated countenance exhibit all the happy finesse of
his profession, when a silk gown has been added, or is likely to be
added to it; and several figures in the Cockpit, who are evidently,
at the first glance, gentlemen of the old school, and where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>mixture of the blacklegs with the higher character is a still further
test of the discriminating skill of the painter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, Hogarth had not only a perception of fashion, but a sense
of natural beauty. There are as many pleasing faces in his pictures
as in Sir Joshua. Witness the girl picking the Rake’s pocket in the
Bagnio scene, whom we might suppose to be ‘the Charming Betsy
Careless;’ the Poet’s wife, handsomer than falls to the lot of most
poets, who are generally more intent upon the idea in their own minds
than on the image before them, and are glad to take up with Dulcineas
of their own creating; the theatrical heroine in the Southwark Fair,
who would be an accession to either of our play-houses; the girl
asleep, ogled by the clerk in church time, and the sweetheart of the
Good Apprentice in the reading desk in the second of that series,
almost an ideal face and expression; the girl in her cap selected for a
partner by the footman in the print of Morning, very handsome; and
many others equally so, scattered like ‘stray-gifts of love and beauty’
through these pictures. Hogarth was not then exclusively the painter
of deformity. He painted beauty or ugliness indifferently, as they
came in his way; and was not by nature confined to those faces
which are painful and disgusting, as many would have us believe.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, neither are we to look for the solution of the difficulty in
the difference between the comic and the tragic, between loose
laughter and deep passion. For Mr. Lamb has shewn unanswerably
that Hogarth is quite at home in scenes of the deepest distress, in
the heart-rending calamities of common life, in the expression of
ungovernable rage, silent despair, or moody madness, enhanced by
the tenderest sympathy, or aggravated by the frightful contrast of the
most impenetrable and obdurate insensibility, as we see strikingly
exemplified in the latter prints of the Rake’s Progress. To the
unbeliever in Hogarth’s power over the passions and the feelings of
the heart, the characters there speak like ‘the hand-writing on the
wall.’ If Mr. Lamb has gone too far in paralleling some of these
appalling representations with Shakespear, he was excusable in being
led to set off what may be considered as a staggering paradox against
a rooted prejudice. At any rate, the inferiority of Hogarth (be it
what it may) did not arise from a want of passion and intense feeling;
and in this respect he had the advantage over Fielding, for instance,
and others of our comic writers, who excelled only in the light and
ludicrous. There is in general a distinction, almost an impassable
one, between the power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous;
but these contradictory faculties were reconciled in Hogarth, as they
were in Shakspeare, in Chaucer; and as it is said that they were in
another extraordinary and later instance, Garrick’s acting.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>None of these then will do: neither will the most masterly and
entire keeping of character lead us to an explanation of the grand
and ideal style; for Hogarth possessed the most complete and
absolute mastery over the truth and identity of expression and features
in his subjects. Every stroke of his pencil tells according to a
preconception in his mind. If the eye squints, the mouth is distorted;
every feature acts, and is acted upon by the rest of the face;
even the dress and attitude are such as could be proper to no other
figure: the whole is under the influence of one impulse, that of truth
and nature. Look at the heads in the Cockpit, already mentioned,
one of the most masterly of his productions in this way, where the
workings of the mind are seen in every muscle of the face; and the
same expression, more intense or relaxed, of hope or of fear, is
stamped on each of the characters, so that you could no more
transpose any part of one countenance to another, than you could
change a profile to a front face. Hogarth was, in one sense, strictly
an historical painter: that is, he represented the manners and humours
of mankind in action, and their characters by varied expression.
Every thing in his pictures has life and motion in it. Not only does
the business of the scene never stand still, but every feature is put
into full play; the exact feeling of the moment is brought out, and
carried to its utmost height, and then instantly seized and stamped on
the canvass for ever. The expression is always taken <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en passant</span></i>, in
a state of progress or change, and, as it were, at the salient point.
Besides the excellence of each individual face, the reflection of the
expression from face to face, the contrast and struggle of particular
motives and feelings in the different actors in the scene, as of anger,
contempt, laughter, compassion, are conveyed in the happiest and
most lively manner. His figures are not like the back-ground on
which they are painted: even the pictures on the wall have a
peculiar look of their own. All this is effected by a few decisive
and rapid touches of the pencil, careless in appearance, but infallible
in their results; so that one great criterion of the grand style insisted
on by Sir Joshua Reynolds, that of leaving out the details, and
attending to general character and outline, belonged to Hogarth. He
did not indeed arrive at middle forms or neutral expression, which
Sir Joshua makes another test of the ideal; for Hogarth was not
insipid. That was the last fault with which he could be charged.
But he had breadth and boldness of manner, as well as any of them;
so that neither does that constitute the <i>ideal</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>What then does? We have reduced this to something like the
last remaining quantity in an equation, where all the others have been
ascertained. Hogarth had all the other parts of an original and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>accomplished genius except this, but this he had not. He had an
intense feeling and command over the impressions of sense, of habit,
of character, and passion, the serious and the comic, in a word, of
nature, as it fell within his own observation, or came within the
sphere of his actual experience; but he had little power beyond that
sphere, or sympathy with that which existed only <i>in idea</i>. He was
‘conformed to this world, not transformed.’ If he attempted to
paint Pharaoh’s daughter, and Paul before Felix, he lost himself.
His mind had feet and hands, but not wings to fly with. There is a
mighty world of sense, of custom, of every-day action, of accidents
and objects coming home to us, and interesting because they do so;
the gross, material, stirring, noisy world of common life and selfish
passion, of which Hogarth was absolute lord and master: there is
another mightier world, that which exists only in conception and in
power, the universe of thought and sentiment, that surrounds and is
raised above the ordinary world of reality, as the empyrean surrounds
this nether globe, into which few are privileged to soar with mighty
wings outspread, and in which, as power is given them to embody
their aspiring fancies, to ‘give to airy nothing a local habitation and a
name,’ to fill with imaginary shapes of beauty or sublimity, and make
the dark abyss pregnant, bringing that which is remote home to us,
raising themselves to the lofty, sustaining themselves on the refined
and abstracted, making all things like not what we know and feel in
ourselves, in this ‘ignorant present’ time, but like what they must be
in themselves, at in our noblest idea of them, and stamping that idea
with reality, (but chiefly clothing the best and the highest with
grace and grandeur): this is the ideal in art, in poetry, and in painting.
There are things which are cognisable only to sense, which interest
only our more immediate instincts and passions; the want of food,
the loss of a limb, or a sum of money: there are others that appeal
to different and nobler faculties; the wants of the mind, the hunger
and thirst after truth and beauty; that is, to faculties commensurate
with objects greater and of greater refinement, which to be
grand must extend beyond ourselves to others, and our interests in
which must be refined in proportion as they do so.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c015'><sup>[24]</sup></a> The interest in
these subjects is in proportion to the power of conceiving them and
the power of conceiving them is in proportion to the interest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>affection for them, to the innate bias of the mind to elevate itself
above every thing low, and purify itself from every thing gross.
Hogarth only transcribes or transposes what was tangible and visible,
not the abstracted and intelligible. You see in his pictures only the
faces which you yourself have seen, or others like them; none of
his characters are thinking of any person or thing out of the picture:
you are only interested in the objects of their contention or pursuit,
because they themselves are interested in them. There is nothing
remote in thought, or comprehensive in feeling. The whole is
intensely personal and local: but the interest of the ideal and poetical
style of art, relates to more permanent and universal objects; and the
characters and forms must be such as to correspond with and sustain
that interest, and give external grace and dignity to it. Such were
the subjects which Raphael chose; faces imbued with unalterable sentiment,
and figures, that stand in the eternal silence of thought. He
places before you objects of everlasting interest, events of greatest
magnitude, and persons in them fit for the scene and action—warriors
and kings, princes and nobles, and, greater yet, poets and philosophers;
and mightier than these, patriarchs and apostles, prophets and founders
of religion, saints and martyrs, angels and the Son of God. We
know their importance and their high calling, and we feel that they
do not belie it. We see them as they were painted, with the eye of
faith. The light which they have kindled in the world, is reflected
back upon their faces: the awe and homage which has been paid to
them, is seated upon their brow, and encircles them like a glory.
All those who come before them, are conscious of a superior presence.
For example, the beggars, in the Gate Beautiful, are impressed with
this ideal borrowed character. Would not the cripple and the halt
feel a difference of sensation, and express it outwardly in such circumstances?
And was the painter wrong to transfer this sense of preternatural
power and the confidence of a saving faith to his canvass?
Hogarth’s Pool of Bethesda, on the contrary, is only a collection of
common beggars receiving an alms. The waters may be stirred, but the
mind is not stirred with them. The fowls, again, in the Miraculous
Draught of Fishes, exult and clap their wings, and seem lifted up with
some unusual cause of joy. There is not the same expansive, elevated
principle in Hogarth. He has amiable and praise-worthy characters,
indeed, among his bad ones. The Master of the Industrious and
Idle Apprentice is a good citizen and a virtuous man; but his benevolence
is mechanical and confined: it extends only to his shop, or,
at most, to his ward. His face is not ruffled by passion, nor is it
inspired by thought. To give another instance, the face of the
faithful Female, fainting in the prison-scene in the Rake’s Progress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>is more one of effeminate softness than of distinguished tenderness, or
heroic constancy. But in the pictures of the Mother and Child, by
Raphael and Leonard da Vinci, we see all the tenderness purified
from all the weakness of maternal affection, and exalted by the
prospects of religious faith; so that the piety and devotion of future
generations seems to add its weight to the expression of feminine
sweetness and parental love, to press upon the heart, and breathe in
the countenance. This is the <i>ideal</i>, passion blended with thought and
pointing to distant objects, not debased by grossness, not thwarted by
accident, nor weakened by familiarity, but connected with forms and
circumstances that give the utmost possible expansion and refinement
to the general sentiment. With all my admiration of Hogarth, I
cannot think him equal to Raphael. I do not know whether, if the
port-folio were opened, I would not as soon look over the prints of
Hogarth as those of Raphael; but, assuredly, if the question were
put to me, I would sooner never have seen the prints of Hogarth than
never have seen those of Raphael. It is many years ago since I first
saw the prints of the Cartoons hanging round the old-fashioned parlour
of a little inn in a remote part of the country. I was then young: I
had heard of the fame of the Cartoons, but this was the first time I
had ever been admitted face to face into the presence of those divine
guests. ‘How was I then uplifted!’ Prophets and Apostles stood
before me as in a dream, and the Saviour of the Christian world, with
his attributes of faith and power; miracles were working on the
walls; the hand of Raphael was there; and as his pencil traced the
lines, I saw godlike spirits and lofty shapes descend and walk visibly
the earth, but as if their thoughts still lifted them above the earth.
There I saw the figure of St. Paul, pointing with noble fervour to
‘temples not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;’ and that
finer one of Christ in the boat, whose whole figure seems sustained by
meekness and love; and that of the same person surrounded by his
disciples, like a flock of sheep listening to the music of some divine
shepherd. I knew not how enough to admire them.—Later in life,
I saw other works of this great painter (with more like them)
collected in the Louvre: where Art, at that time, lifted up her
head, and was seated on her throne, and said, ‘All eyes shall see me,
and all knees shall bow to me!’ Honour was done to her and all
hers. There was her treasure, and there the inventory of all she
had. There she had gathered together her pomp, and there was her
shrine, and there her votaries came and worshipped as in a temple.
The crown she wore was brighter than that of kings. Where the
struggles for human liberty had been, there were the triumphs of
human genius. For there, in the Louvre, were the precious monuments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of art:—There ‘stood the statue that enchants the world;’
there was Apollo, the Laocoon, the Dying Gladiator, the head of
the Antinous, Diana with her Fawn, the Muses and the Graces in
a ring, and all the glories of the antique world:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There was old Proteus coming from the sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>And wreathed Triton blew his winding horn.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>There, too, were the two St. Jeromes, Correggio’s, and Domenichino’s;
there was Raphael’s Transfiguration; the St. Mark of
Tintoret; Paul Veronese’s Marriage of Cana; the Deluge of
Poussin; and Titian’s St. Peter Martyr. It was there that I
learned to become an enthusiast of the lasting works of the great
painters, and of their names no less magnificent; grateful to the
heart as the sound of celestial harmony from other spheres, waking
around us (whether heard or not) from youth to age; the stay, the
guide, and anchor of our purest thoughts; whom, having once seen,
we always remember, and who teach us to see all things through
them; without whom life would be to begin again, and the earth
barren; of Raphael, who lifted the human form half way to heaven;
of Titian, who painted the mind in the face, and unfolded the soul
of things to the eye; of Rubens, around whose pencil gorgeous shapes
thronged numberless, startling us by the novel accidents of form and
colour, putting the spirit of motion into the universe, and weaving
a gay fantastic round and Bacchanalian dance with nature; of
Rembrandt, too, who ‘smoothed the raven down of darkness till it
smiled,’ and tinged it with a light like streaks of burning ore: of
these, and more than these, of whom the world was scarce worthy,
and for the loss of whom nothing could console me—not even the
works of Hogarth!</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c008'>LECTURE VIII<br /> <span class='c013'>ON THE COMIC WRITERS OF THE LAST CENTURY</span></h3>

<p class='c009'>The question which has been often asked, <i>Why there are comparatively
so few good modern Comedies?</i> appears in a great measure to answer
itself. It is because so many excellent comedies have been written,
that there are none written at present. Comedy naturally wears itself
out—destroys the very food on which it lives; and by constantly
and successfully exposing the follies and weaknesses of mankind
to ridicule, in the end leaves itself nothing worth laughing at. It
holds the mirror up to nature; and men, seeing their most striking
peculiarities and defects pass in gay review before them, learn either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>to avoid or conceal them. It is not the criticism which the public
taste exercises upon the stage, but the criticism which the stage
exercises upon public manners, that is fatal to comedy, by rendering
the subject-matter of it tame, correct, and spiritless. We are drilled
into a sort of stupid decorum, and forced to wear the same dull
uniform of outward appearance; and yet it is asked, why the Comic
Muse does not point, as she was wont, at the peculiarities of our gait
and gesture, and exhibit the picturesque contrasts of our dress and
costume, in all that graceful variety in which she delights. The
genuine source of comic writing,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Where it must live, or have no life at all,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>is undoubtedly to be found in the distinguishing peculiarities of men
and manners. Now this distinction can subsist, so as to be strong,
pointed, and general, only while the manners of different classes are
formed almost immediately by their particular circumstances, and the
characters of individuals by their natural temperament and situation,
without being everlastingly modified and neutralized by intercourse
with the world—by knowledge and education. In a certain stage of
society, men may be said to vegetate like trees, and to become rooted
to the soil in which they grow. They have no idea of any thing
beyond themselves and their immediate sphere of action; they are, as
it were, circumscribed, and defined by their particular circumstances;
they are what their situation makes them, and nothing more. Each
is absorbed in his own profession or pursuit, and each in his turn contracts
that habitual peculiarity of manners and opinions which makes
him the subject of ridicule to others, and the sport of the Comic
Muse. Thus the physician is nothing but a physician, the lawyer is
a mere lawyer, the scholar degenerates into a pedant, the country
squire is a different species of being from the fine gentleman, the
citizen and the courtier inhabit a different world, and even the
affectation of certain characters, in aping the follies or vices of their
betters, only serves to shew the immeasurable distance which custom
or fortune has placed between them. Hence the earlier comic writers,
taking advantage of this mixed and solid mass of ignorance, folly,
pride, and prejudice, made those deep and lasting incisions into it,—have
given those sharp and nice touches, that bold relief to their
characters,—have opposed them in every variety of contrast and
collision, of conscious self-satisfaction and mutual antipathy, with a
power which can only find full scope in the same rich and inexhaustible
materials. But in proportion as comic genius succeeds in
taking off the mask from ignorance and conceit, as it teaches us</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To see ourselves as others see us,’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>in proportion as we are brought out on the stage together, and our
prejudices clash one against the other, our sharp angular points wear
off; we are no longer rigid in absurdity, passionate in folly, and we
prevent the ridicule directed at our habitual foibles by laughing at
them ourselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>If it be said, that there is the same fund of absurdity and prejudice
in the world as ever—that there are the same unaccountable perversities
lurking at the bottom of every breast,—I should answer,
Be it so: but at least we keep our follies to ourselves as much as
possible; we palliate, shuffle, and equivocate with them; they sneak
into bye-corners, and do not, like <i>Chaucer’s Canterbury Pilgrims</i>,
march along the high road, and form a procession; they do not
entrench themselves strongly behind custom and precedent; they are
not embodied in professions and ranks in life; they are not organized
into a system; they do not openly resort to a standard, but are a sort
of straggling non-descripts, that, like <i>Wart</i>, ‘present no mark to the
foeman.’ As to the gross and palpable absurdities of modern manners,
they are too shallow and barefaced, and those who affect are too little
<i>serious</i> in them, to make them worth the detection of the Comic Muse.
They proceed from an idle, impudent affectation of folly in general,
in the dashing <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravura</span></i> style, not from an infatuation with any of
its characteristic modes. In short, the proper object of ridicule is
<i>egotism</i>: and a man cannot be a very great egotist, who every day
sees himself represented on the stage. We are deficient in comedy,
because we are without characters in real life—as we have no historical
pictures, because we have no faces proper for them.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is, indeed, the evident tendency of all literature to generalise and
<i>dissipate</i> character, by giving men the same artificial education, and
the same common stock of ideas; so that we see all objects from the
same point of view, and through the same reflected medium;—we
learn to exist, not in ourselves, but in books;—all men become alike
mere readers—spectators, not actors in the scene, and lose their
proper personal identity. The templar, the wit, the man of pleasure,
and the man of fashion, the courtier and the citizen, the knight and
the squire, the lover and the miser—<i>Lovelace</i>, <i>Lothario</i>, <i>Will Honeycomb</i>,
and <i>Sir Roger de Coverley</i>, <i>Sparkish</i> and <i>Lord Foppington</i>,
<i>Western</i> and <i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>My Father</i> and <i>My Uncle Toby</i>, <i>Millamant</i>
and <i>Sir Sampson Legend</i>, <cite>Don Quixote</cite> and <i>Sancho</i>, <i>Gil Blas</i> and
<i>Guzman d’Alfarache</i>, <i>Count Fathom</i> and <i>Joseph Surface</i>,—have met
and exchanged common-places on the barren plains of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">haute
littérature</span></i><a id='t151'></a>—toil slowly on to the temple of science, ‘seen a long way
off upon a level,’ and end in one dull compound of politics, criticism,
and metaphysics!</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>We cannot expect to reconcile opposite things. If, for example,
any of us were to put ourselves into the stage-coach from Salisbury
to London, it is more than probable we should not meet with the
same number of odd accidents, or ludicrous distresses on the road,
that befel <i>Parson Adams</i>; but why, if we get into a common vehicle,
and submit to the conveniences of modern travelling, should we complain
of the want of adventures? Modern manners may be compared
to a modern stage-coach; our limbs may be a little cramped with the
confinement, and we may grow drowsy, but we arrive safe, without
any very amusing or very sad accident, at our journey’s end.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this theory I have, at least, the authority of Sterne and the
Tatler on my side, who attribute the greater variety and richness of
comic excellence in our writers, to the greater variety and distinctness
of character among ourselves; the roughness of the texture and
the sharp angles not being worn out by the artificial refinements of
intellect, or the frequent collision of social intercourse.—It has been
argued on the other hand, indeed, that this circumstance makes
against me; that the suppression of the grosser indications of
absurdity ought to stimulate and give scope to the ingenuity and
penetration of the comic writer who is to detect them; and that
the progress of wit and humour ought to keep pace with critical distinctions
and metaphysical niceties. Some theorists, indeed, have
been sanguine enough to expect a regular advance from grossness to
refinement on the stage and in real life, marked on a graduated scale
of human perfectibility, and have been hence led to imagine that the
best of our old comedies were no better than the coarse jests of a set
of country clowns—a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comedies bourgeoises</span></i>, compared with the
admirable productions which might, but have not, been written in our
times. I must protest against this theory altogether, which would
go to degrade genteel comedy from a high court lady into a literary
prostitute. I do not know what these persons mean by refinement
in this instance. Do they find none in Millamant and her morning
dreams, in Sir Roger de Coverley and his widow? Did not Etherege,
Wycherley, and Congreve, approach tolerably near</p>

<p class='c017'>Is there no distinction between an Angelica and a Miss Prue, a
Valentine, a Tattle, and a Ben? Where, in the annals of modern
literature, shall we find any thing more refined, more deliberate, more
abstracted in vice, than the nobleman in Amelia? Are not the compliments
which Pope paid to his friends equal in taste and elegance to
any which have been paid since? Are there no traits in Sterne? Is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>not Richardson minute enough? Must we part with Sophia Western
and her muff, and Clarissa Harlowe’s ‘preferable regards’ for the
loves of the plants and the triangles? Or shall we say that the
Berinthias and Alitheas of former times were little rustics, because
they did not, like our modern belles, subscribe to circulating libraries,
read Beppo, prefer Gertrude of Wyoming to the Lady of the Lake,
or the Lady of the Lake to Gertrude of Wyoming, differ in their
sentiments on points of taste or systems of mineralogy, and deliver
dissertations on the arts with Corinna of Italy? They had something
else to do and to talk about. They were employed in reality,
as we see them on the stage, in setting off their charms to the
greatest advantage, in mortifying their rivals by the most pointed
irony, and trifling with their lovers with infinite address. The height
of comic elegance and refinement is not to be found in the general
diffusion of knowledge and civilization, which tends to level and
neutralize, but in the pride of individual distinction, and the contrast
between the conflicting pretensions of different ranks in society.</p>

<p class='c014'>For this reason I conceive that the alterations which have taken
place in conversation and dress, in consequence of the change of
manners in the same period, have been by no means favourable to
comedy. The present prevailing style of conversation is not <i>personal</i>,
but critical and analytical. It consists almost entirely in the discussion
of general topics, in ascertaining the merits of authors and their
works: and Congreve would be able to derive no better hints from
the conversations of our toilettes or drawing-rooms, for the exquisite
raillery or poignant repartee of his dialogues, than from a deliberation
of the Royal Society. In manner, the extreme simplicity and
graceful uniformity of modern dress, however favourable to the arts,
has certainly stript comedy of one of its richest ornaments and most
expressive symbols. The sweeping pall and buskin, and nodding
plume, were never more serviceable to tragedy, than the enormous
hoops and stiff stays worn by the belles of former days, were to
the intrigues of comedy. They assisted wonderfully in heightening
the mysteries of the passion, and adding to the intricacy of
the plot. Wycherley and Vanbrugh could not have spared the
dresses of Vandyke. These strange fancy-dresses, perverse disguises,
and counterfeit shapes, gave an agreeable scope to the imagination.
‘That sevenfold fence’ was a sort of foil to the lusciousness of the
dialogue, and a barrier against the sly encroachments of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i>.
The greedy eye and bold hand of indiscretion were repressed, which
gave a greater license to the tongue. The senses were not to be
gratified in an instant. Love was entangled in the folds of the
swelling handkerchief, and the desires might wander for ever round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the circumference of a quilted petticoat, or find a rich lodging in the
flowers of a damask stomacher. There was room for years of patient
contrivance, for a thousand thoughts, schemes, conjectures, hopes,
fears, and wishes. There seemed no end of obstacles and delays; to
overcome so many difficulties was the work of ages. A mistress was
an angel, concealed behind whalebone, flounces, and brocade. What
an undertaking to penetrate through the disguise! What an impulse
must it give to the blood, what a keenness to the invention, what a
volubility to the tongue! ‘Mr. Smirk, you are a brisk man,’ was
then the most significant commendation; but now-a-days—a woman
can be <i>but undressed</i>!—Again, the character of the fine gentleman is
at present a little obscured on the stage, nor do we immediately
recognise it elsewhere, for want of the formidable <i>insignia</i> of a bag-wig
and sword. Without these outward credentials, the public must
not only be unable to distinguish this character intuitively, but it must
be ‘almost afraid to know itself.’ The present simple disguise of a
gentleman is like the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</span></i> of kings. The opinion of others affects
our opinion of ourselves; and we can hardly expect from a modern
man of fashion that air of dignity and superior gracefulness of carriage,
which those must have assumed who were conscious that all eyes
were upon them, and that their lofty pretensions continually exposed
them either to public scorn or challenged public admiration. A lord
who should take the wall of the plebeian passengers without a sword
by his side, would hardly have his claim of precedence acknowledged;
nor could he be supposed to have that obsolete air of self-importance
about him, which should alone clear the pavement at his approach.
It is curious how an ingenious actor of the present day (Mr. Farren)
should play Lord Ogleby so well as he does, having never seen any
thing of the sort in reality. A nobleman in full costume, and in
broad day, would be a phenomenon like the lord mayor’s coach.
The attempt at getting up genteel comedy at present is a sort of
Galvanic experiment, a revival of the dead.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c015'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>I have observed in a former Lecture, that the most spirited æra of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>our comic drama was that which reflected the conversation, tone, and
manners of the profligate, but witty age of Charles II. With the
graver and more business-like turn which the Revolution probably
gave to our minds, comedy stooped from her bolder and more
fantastic flights; and the ferocious attack made by the nonjuring
divine, Jeremy Collier, on the immorality and profaneness of the
plays then chiefly in vogue, nearly frightened those unwarrantable
liberties of wit and humour from the stage, which were no longer
countenanced at court nor copied in the city. Almost the last of our
writers who ventured to hold out in the prohibited track, was a female
adventurer, Mrs. Centlivre, who seemed to take advantage of the
privilege of her sex, and to set at defiance the cynical denunciations
of the angry puritanical reformist. Her plays have a provoking spirit
and volatile salt in them, which still preserves them from decay.
Congreve is said to have been jealous of their success at the time, and
that it was one cause which drove him in disgust from the stage. If
so, it was without any good reason: for these plays have great and
intrinsic merit in them, which entitled them to their popularity (and
it is only spurious and undeserved popularity which should excite a
feeling of jealousy in any well-regulated mind): and besides, their
merit was of a kind entirely different from his own. The Wonder
and the Busy Body are properly comedies of intrigue. Their interest
depends chiefly on the intricate involution and artful <i>denouement</i> of the
plot, which has a strong tincture of mischief in it, and the wit is
seasoned by the archness of the humour and sly allusion to the most
delicate points. They are plays evidently written by a very clever
woman, but still by a woman: for I hold, in spite of any fanciful
theories to the contrary, that there is a distinction discernible in the
minds of women as well as in their faces. The Wonder is one of
the best of our acting plays. The passion of jealousy in Don Felix
is managed in such a way as to give as little offence as possible to the
audience, for every appearance combines to excite and confirm his
worst suspicions, while we, who are in the secret, laugh at his groundless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>uneasiness and apprehensions. The ambiguity of the heroine’s
situation, which is like a continued practical <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">equivoque</span></i>, gives rise to a
quick succession of causeless alarms, subtle excuses, and the most
hair-breadth ‘scapes. The scene near the end, in which Don Felix,
pretending to be drunk, forces his way out of Don Manuel’s house,
who wants to keep him a prisoner, by producing his marriage-contract
in the shape of a pocket-pistol, with the terrors and confusion into
which the old gentleman is thrown by this sort of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum ad
hominem</span></i>, is one of the richest treats the stage affords, and calls forth
incessant peals of laughter and applause. Besides the two principal
characters (Violante and Don Felix) Lissardo and Flippanta come
in very well to carry on the under-plot; and the airs and graces of an
amorous waiting-maid and conceited man-servant, each copying after
their master and mistress, were never hit off with more natural
volubility or affected <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</span></i> than in this enviable couple.
Lissardo’s playing off the diamond ring before the eyes of his
mortified Dulcinea, and aping his master’s absent manner while
repeating—‘Roast me these Violantes,’ as well as the jealous quarrel
of the two waiting-maids, which threatens to end in some very extraordinary
discoveries, are among the most amusing traits in this
comedy. Colonel Breton, the lover of Clara, is a spirited and
enterprising soldier of fortune; and his servant Gibby’s undaunted,
incorrigible blundering, with a dash of nationality in it, tells in a very
edifying way.—The Busy Body is inferior, in the interest of the
story and characters, to the Wonder; but it is full of bustle and
gaiety from beginning to end. The plot never stands still; the
situations succeed one another like the changes of machinery in a
pantomime. The nice dove-tailing of the incidents, and cross-reading
in the situations, supplies the place of any great force of wit or sentiment.
The time for the entrance of each person on the stage is the
moment when they are least wanted, and when their arrival makes
either themselves or somebody else look as foolish as possible. The
laughableness of this comedy, as well as of the Wonder, depends on
a brilliant series of mistimed exits and entrances. Marplot is the
whimsical hero of the piece, and a standing memorial of unmeaning
vivacity and assiduous impertinence.</p>

<p class='c014'>The comedies of Steele were the first that were written expressly
with a view not to imitate the manners, but to reform the morals of
the age. The author seems to be all the time on his good behaviour,
as if writing a comedy was no very creditable employment, and as if
the ultimate object of his ambition was a dedication to the queen.
Nothing can be better meant, or more inefficient. It is almost a
misnomer to call them comedies; they are rather homilies in dialogue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>in which a number of very pretty ladies and gentlemen discuss the
fashionable topics of gaming, of duelling, of seduction, of scandal, &amp;c.
with a sickly sensibility, that shews as little hearty aversion to vice,
as sincere attachment to virtue. By not meeting the question fairly
on the ground of common experience, by slubbering over the objections,
and varnishing over the answers, the whole distinction between
virtue and vice (as it appears in evidence in the comic drama) is
reduced to verbal professions, and a mechanical, infantine goodness.
The sting is, indeed, taken out of what is bad; but what is good, at
the same time, loses its manhood and nobility of nature by this
enervating process. I am unwilling to believe that the only difference
between right and wrong is mere cant, or <i>make-believe</i>; and I imagine,
that the advantage which the moral drama possesses over mere
theoretical precept or general declamation is this, that by being left
free to imitate nature as it is, and not being referred to an ideal
standard, it is its own voucher for the truth of the inferences it draws,
for its warnings, or its examples; that it brings out the higher, as
well as lower principles of action, in the most striking and convincing
points of view; satisfies us that virtue is not a mere shadow; clothes
it with passion, imagination, reality, and, if I may so say, translates
morality from the language of theory into that of practice. But
Steele, by introducing the artificial mechanism of morals on the stage,
and making his characters act, not from individual motives and
existing circumstances, the truth of which every one must feel, but
from vague topics and general rules, the truth of which is the very
thing to be proved in detail, has lost that fine ‘vantage ground which
the stage lends to virtue; takes away from it its best grace, the grace
of sincerity; and, instead of making it a test of truth, has made it an
echo of the doctrine of the schools—and ‘the one cries <i>Mum</i>, while
t’other cries <i>Budget</i>!’ The comic writer, in my judgment, then,
ought to open the volume of nature and the world for his living
materials, and not take them out of his ethical common-place book;
for in this way, neither will throw any additional light upon the
other. In all things there is a division of labour; and I am as little
for introducing the tone of the pulpit or reading-desk on the stage, as
for introducing plays and interludes in church-time, according to the
good old popish practice. It was a part, indeed, of Steele’s plan, ‘by
the politeness of his style and the genteelness of his expressions,’<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c015'><sup>[26]</sup></a> to
bring about a reconciliation between things which he thought had
hitherto been kept too far asunder, to wed the graces to the virtues,
and blend pleasure with profit. And in this design he succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>admirably in his Tatler, and some other works; but in his comedies
he has failed. He has confounded, instead of harmonising—has
taken away its gravity from wisdom, and its charm from gaiety. It
is not that in his plays we find ‘some soul of goodness in things evil;’
but they have no soul either of good or bad. His Funeral is as trite,
as tedious, and full of formal grimace, as a procession of mutes and
undertakers. The characters are made either affectedly good and
forbearing, with ‘all the milk of human kindness;’ or purposely bad
and disgusting, for the others to exercise their squeamish charities
upon them. The Conscious Lovers is the best; but that is far from
good, with the exception of the scene between Mr. Thomas and
Phillis, who are fellow-servants, and commence lovers from being set
to clean the window together. We are here once more in the
company of our old friend, Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq. Indiana is as
listless, and as insipid, as a drooping figure on an Indian screen; and
Mr. Myrtle and Mr. Bevil only just disturb the still life of the scene.
I am sorry that in this censure I should have Parson Adams against
me; who thought the Conscious Lovers the only play fit for a
Christian to see, and as good as a sermon. For myself, I would
rather have read, or heard him read, one of his own manuscript
sermons: and if the volume which he left behind him in his saddlebags
was to be had in print, for love or money, I would at any time
walk ten miles on foot only to get a sight of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Addison’s Drummer, or the Haunted House, is a pleasant farce
enough; but adds nothing to our idea of the author of the Spectator.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pope’s joint after-piece, called ‘An Hour after Marriage,’ was not
a successful attempt. He brought into it ‘an alligator stuff’d,’ which
disconcerted the ladies, and gave just offence to the critics. Pope
was too fastidious for a farce-writer; and yet the most fastidious
people, when they step out of their regular routine, are apt to become
the grossest. The smallest offences against probability or decorum
are, to their habitual scrupulousness, as unpardonable as the greatest.
This was the rock on which Pope probably split. The affair was,
however, hushed up; and he wreaked his discreet vengeance at
leisure on the ‘odious endeavours,’ and more odious success of Colley
Cibber in the line in which he had failed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gay’s ‘What-d’ye-call-it,’ is not one of his happiest things. His
‘Polly’ is a complete failure, which, indeed, is the common fate of
second parts. If the original Polly, in the Beggar’s Opera, had not
had more winning ways with her, she would hardly have had so
many Countesses for representatives as she has had, from her first
appearance up to the present moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fielding was a comic writer, as well as a novelist; but his comedies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>are very inferior to his novels: they are particularly deficient both in
plot and character. The only excellence which they have is that of
the style, which is the only thing in which his novels are deficient.
The only dramatic pieces of Fielding that retain possession of the
stage are, the Mock Doctor (a tolerable translation from Moliere’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Médecin malgré lui</span></i><a id='t159'></a>), and his Tom Thumb, a very admirable piece of
burlesque. The absurdities and bathos of some of our celebrated
tragic writers could hardly be credited, but for the notes at the
bottom of this preposterous medley of bombast, containing his
authorities and the parallel passages. Dryden, Lee, and Shadwell,
make no very shining figure there. Mr. Liston makes a better figure
in the text. His Lord Grizzle is prodigious. What a name, and
what a person! It has been said of this ingenious actor, that ‘he is
very great in Liston;’ but he is even greater in Lord Grizzle.
What a wig is that he wears! How flighty, flaunting, and fantastical!
Not ‘like those hanging locks of young Apollo,’ nor like the serpent-hair
of the Furies of Æschylus; but as troublous, though not as
tragical as the one—as imposing, though less classical than the other.
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que terribles sont ces cheveux gris</span></i>,’ might be applied to Lord
Grizzle’s most valiant and magnanimous curls. This sapient courtier’s
‘fell of hair does at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as if life were
in’t.’ His wits seem flying away with the disorder of his flowing
locks, and to sit as loosely on our hero’s head as the caul of his
peruke. What a significant vacancy in his open eyes and mouth!
what a listlessness in his limbs! what an abstraction of all thought or
purpose! With what an headlong impulse of enthusiasm he throws
himself across the stage when he is going to be married, crying, ‘Hey
for Doctor’s Commons,’ as if the genius of folly had taken whole-length
possession of his person! And then his dancing is equal to
the discovery of a sixth sense—which is certainly very different from
<i>common sense</i>! If this extraordinary personage cuts a great figure in
his life, he is no less wonderful in his death and burial. ‘From the
sublime to the ridiculous there is but one step;’ and this character
would almost seem to prove, that there is but one step from the
ridiculous to the sublime.—Lubin Log, however inimitable in itself,
is itself an imitation of something existing elsewhere; but the Lord
Grizzle of this truly original actor, is a pure invention of his own.
His Caper, in the Widow’s Choice, can alone dispute the palm with
it in incoherence and volatility; for that, too, ‘is high fantastical,’
almost as full of emptiness, in as grand a gusto of insipidity, as profoundly
absurd, as elaborately nonsensical! Why does not Mr.
Liston play in some of Moliere’s farces? I heartily wish that the
author of Love, Law, and Physic, would launch him on the London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>boards in Monsieur Jourdain, or Monsieur Pourceaugnac. The
genius of Liston and Moliere together—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——Must bid a gay defiance to mischance.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Liston is an actor hardly belonging to the present age. Had he
lived, unfortunately for us, in the time of Colley Cibber, we should
have seen what a splendid niche he would have given him in his
Apology.</p>

<p class='c014'>Cibber is the hero of the Dunciad; but it cannot be said of him,
that he was ‘by merit raised to that bad eminence.’ He was pert,
not dull; a coxcomb, not a blockhead; vain, but not malicious.
Pope’s unqualified abuse of him was mere spleen; and the most
obvious provocation to it seems to have been an excess of flippant
vivacity in the constitution of Cibber. That Cibber’s Birth-day
Odes were dull, is true; but this was not peculiar to him. It is an
objection which may be made equally to Shadwell’s, to Whitehead’s,
to Warton’s, to Pye’s, and to all others, except those which of late
years have <i>not</i> been written! In his Apology for his own Life,
Cibber is a most amusing biographer: happy in his own good opinion,
the best of all others; teeming with animal spirits, and uniting the
self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity of age. His account of
his waiting as a page behind the chair of the old Duchess of
Marlborough, at the time of the Revolution, who was then in the
bloom of youth and beauty, which seems to have called up in him the
secret homage of ‘distant, enthusiastic, respectful love,’ fifty years
after, and the compliment he pays to her (then in her old age), ‘a
great grandmother without grey hairs,’ is as delightful as any thing in
fiction or romance; and is the evident origin of Mr. Burke’s
celebrated apostrophe to the Queen of France. Nor is the political
confession of faith which he makes on this occasion, without a suitable
mixture of vanity and sincerity: the vanity we may ascribe to the
player, the sincerity to the politician. The self-complacency with
which he talks of his own success both as a player and a writer, is not
greater than the candour and cordiality with which he does heaped
justice to the merits of his theatrical contemporaries and predecessors.
He brings down the history of the stage, either by the help of
observation or tradition, from the time of Shakspeare to his own; and
quite dazzles the reader with a constellation of male and female, of
tragic and comic, of past and present excellence. He gives portraits
at full length of Kynaston, of Betterton, of Booth, of Estcourt, of
Penkethman and Dogget, of Mohun and Wilks, of Nokes and Sandford,
of Mrs. Montford, of Mrs. Oldfield, of Mrs. Barry and Mrs.
Bracegirdle, and of others of equal note; with delectable criticisms on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>their several performances, and anecdotes of their private lives, with
scarcely a single particle of jealousy or ill-nature, or any other motive
than to expatiate in the delight of talking of the ornaments of his art,
and a wish to share his pleasure with the reader. I wish I could
quote some of these theatrical sketches; but the time presses. The
latter part of his work is less entertaining when he becomes Manager,
and gives us an exact statement of his squabbles with the Lord
Chamberlain, and the expense of his ground-rent, his repairs, his
scenery, and his dresses.—In his plays, his personal character perhaps
predominates too much over the inventiveness of his Muse; but so
far from being dull, he is every where light, fluttering, and airy.
His pleasure in himself made him desirous to please; but his fault
was, that he was too soon satisfied with what he did, that his indolence
or want of thought led him to indulge in the vein that flowed
from him with most ease, and that his vanity did not allow him to
distinguish between what he did best and worst. His Careless
Husband is a very elegant piece of agreeable, thoughtless writing;
and the incident of Lady Easy throwing her handkerchief over her
husband, whom she finds asleep in a chair by the side of her waiting-woman,
was an admirable contrivance, taken, as he informs us, from
real life. His Double Gallant, which has been lately revived, though
it cannot rank in the first, may take its place in the second or third
class of comedies. It abounds in character, bustle, and stage-effect.
It belongs to what may be called the composite style; and very
happily mixes up the comedy of intrigue, such as we see it in
Mrs. Centlivre’s Spanish plots, with a tolerable share of the wit and
spirit of Congreve and Vanbrugh. As there is a good deal of wit,
there is a spice of wickedness in this play, which was a privilege of the
good old style of comedy, not altogether abandoned in Cibber’s time.
The luscious vein of the dialogue is stopped short in many of the scenes
of the revived play, though not before we perceive its object—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>‘——In hidden mazes running,</div>
      <div class='line'>With wanton haste and giddy cunning.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>These imperfect hints of double meanings, however, pass off without
any marks of reprobation; for unless they are insisted on, or made
pretty broad, the audience, from being accustomed to the cautious
purity of the modern drama, are not very expert in decyphering the
equivocal allusion, for which they are not on the look-out. To what
is this increased nicety owing? Was it that vice, from being formerly
less common (though more fashionable) was less catching than at
present? The first inference is by no means in our favour: for
though I think that the grossness of manners prevailing in our fashionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>comedies was a direct transcript of the manners of the court at
the time, or in the period immediately preceding, yet the same grossness
of expression and allusion existed long before, as in the plays of
Shakspeare and Ben Jonson, when there was not this grossness of
manners, and it has of late years been gradually refining away. There
is a certain grossness or freedom of expression, which may arise as
often from unsuspecting simplicity as from avowed profligacy. Whatever
may be our progress either in virtue or vice since the age of
Charles II. certain it is, that our manners are not mended since the
time of Elizabeth and Charles <span class='fss'>I.</span> Is it, then, that vice was formerly
a thing more to be wondered at than imitated; that behind the rigid
barriers of religion and morality it might be exposed freely, without
the danger of any serious practical consequences—whereas now that
the safeguards of wholesome authority and prejudice are removed, we
seem afraid to trust our eyes or ears with a single situation or expression
of a loose tendency, as if the mere mention of licentiousness
implied a conscious approbation of it, and the extreme delicacy of
our moral sense would be debauched by the bare suggestion of the
possibility of vice? But I shall not take upon me to answer this
question. The characters in the Double Gallant are well kept up:
At-All and Lady Dainty are the two most prominent characters in
this comedy, and those into which Cibber has put most of his own
nature and genius. They are the essence of active impertinence and
fashionable frivolity. Cibber, in short, though his name has been
handed down to us as a bye-word of impudent pretension and
impenetrable dulness by the classical pen of his accomplished rival,
who, unfortunately, did not admit of any merit beyond the narrow
circle of wit and friendship in which he himself moved, was a gentleman
and a scholar of the old school; a man of wit and pleasantry in
conversation, a diverting mimic, an excellent actor, an admirable
dramatic critic, and one of the best comic writers of his age. His
works, instead of being a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of literature, had a great deal
of the spirit, with a little too much of the froth. His Nonjuror was
taken from Moliere’s Tartuffe, and has been altered to the Hypocrite.
Love’s Last Shift appears to have been his own favourite; and he
received the compliments of Sir John Vanbrugh and old Mr. Southern
upon it:—the latter said to him, ‘Young man, your play is a good
one; and it will succeed, if you do not spoil it by your acting.’
His plays did not always take equally. It is ludicrous to hear him
complaining of the ill success of one of them, Love in a Riddle, a
pastoral comedy, ‘of a nice morality,’ and well spoken sentiments,
which he wrote in opposition to the Beggar’s Opera, at the time
when its worthless and vulgar rival was carrying every thing triumphantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>before it. Cibber brings this, with much pathetic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>, as
an instance of the lamentable want of taste in the town!</p>

<p class='c014'>The Suspicious Husband by Hoadley, the Jealous Wife by
Colman, and the Clandestine Marriage by Colman and Garrick, are
excellent plays of the middle style of comedy; which are formed
rather by judgment and selection, than by any original vein of genius;
and have all the parts of a good comedy in degree, without having
any one prominent, or to excess. The character of Ranger, in the
Suspicious Husband, is only a variation of those of Farquhar, of
the same class as his Sir Harry Wildair and others, without equal
spirit. A great deal of the story of the Jealous Wife is borrowed
from Fielding; but so faintly, that the resemblance is hardly discernible
till you are apprised of it. The Jealous Wife herself is,
however, a dramatic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span></i>, and worthy of being acted as often,
and better than it is. Sir Harry Beagle is a true fox-hunting English
squire. The Clandestine Marriage is nearly without a fault; and
has some lighter theatrical graces, which I suspect Garrick threw
into it. <i>Canton</i> is, I should think, his; though this classification of
him among the ornamental parts of the play may seem whimsical.
Garrick’s genius does not appear to have been equal to the construction
of a solid drama; but he could retouch and embellish with
great gaiety and knowledge of the technicalities of his art. Garrick
not only produced joint-pieces and after-pieces, but often set off the
plays of his friends and contemporaries with the garnish, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sauce
piquant</span></i>, of prologues and epilogues, at which he had an admirable
knack.—The elder Colman’s translation of Terence, I may here add,
has always been considered, by good judges, as an equal proof of
the author’s knowledge of the Latin language, and taste in his own.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bickerstaff’s plays and comic operas are continually acted: they
come under the class of mediocrity, generally speaking. Their
popularity seems to be chiefly owing to the unaffected ease and want
of pretension with which they are written, with a certain humorous
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> in the lower characters, and an exquisite adaptation of the
music to the songs. His Love in a Village is one of the most
delightful comic operas on the stage. It is truly pastoral; and the
sense of music hovers over the very scene like the breath of morning.
In his alteration of the Tartuffe he has spoiled the Hypocrite, but he
has added Maw-worm.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Cowley’s comedy of the Belles’ Stratagem, Who’s the
Dupe, and others, are of the second or third class: they are rather
<i>refaccimentos</i> of the characters, incidents, and materials of former
writers, got up with considerable liveliness and ingenuity, than
original compositions, with marked qualities of their own.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Goldsmith’s Good-natured Man is inferior to She Stoops to Conquer;
and even this last play, with all its shifting vivacity, is rather a
sportive and whimsical effusion of the author’s fancy, a delightful and
delicately managed caricature, than a genuine comedy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Murphy’s plays of All in the Wrong and Know Your Own Mind,
are admirably written; with sense, spirit, and conception of character:
but without any great effect of the humorous, or that truth of feeling
which distinguishes the boundary between the absurdities of natural
character and the gratuitous fictions of the poet’s pen. The heroes
of these two plays, Millamour and Sir Benjamin Constant, are too
ridiculous in their caprices to be tolerated, except in farce; and yet
their follies are so flimsy, so motiveless, and fine-spun, as not to be
intelligible, or to have any effect in their only proper sphere. Both his
principal pieces are said to have suffered by their similarity, first, to
Colman’s Jealous Wife, and next to the School for Scandal, though
in both cases he had the undoubted priority. It is hard that the fate
of plagiarism should attend upon originality: yet it is clear that the
elements of the School for Scandal are not sparingly scattered in
Murphy’s comedy of Know your own Mind, which appeared before
the latter play, only to be eclipsed by it. This brings me to speak of
Sheridan.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Sheridan has been justly called ‘a dramatic star of the first
magnitude:’ and, indeed, among the comic writers of the last
century, he ‘shines like Hesperus among the lesser lights.’ He has
left four several dramas behind him, all different or of different kinds,
and all excellent in their way;—the School for Scandal, the Rivals,
the Duenna, and the Critic. The attraction of this last piece is,
however, less in the mock-tragedy rehearsed, than in the dialogue of
the comic scenes, and in the character of Sir Fretful Plagiary, which
is supposed to have been intended for Cumberland. If some of the
characters in the School for Scandal were contained in Murphy’s
comedy of Know your own Mind (and certainly some of Dashwoud’s
detached speeches and satirical sketches are written with quite as firm
and masterly a hand as any of those given to the members of the
scandalous club, Mrs. Candour or Lady Sneerwell), yet they were
buried in it for want of grouping and relief, like the colours of a well-drawn
picture sunk in the canvass. Sheridan brought them out, and
exhibited them in all their glory. If that gem, the character of
Joseph Surface, was Murphy’s, the splendid and more valuable setting
was Sheridan’s. He took Murphy’s Malvil from his lurking-place
in the closet, and ‘dragged the struggling monster into day’ upon
the stage. That is, he gave interest, life, and action, or, in other
words, its dramatic being, to the mere conception and written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>specimens of a character. This is the merit of Sheridan’s comedies,
that every thing in them <i>tells</i>; there is no labour in vain. His
Comic Muse does not go about prying into obscure corners, or collecting
idle curiosities, but shews her laughing face, and points to her
rich treasure—the follies of mankind. She is garlanded and crowned
with roses and vine-leaves. Her eyes sparkle with delight, and her
heart runs over with good-natured malice. Her step is firm and light,
and her ornaments consummate! The School for Scandal is, if not
the most original, perhaps the most finished and faultless comedy
which we have. When it is acted, you hear people all around
you exclaiming, ‘Surely it is impossible for any thing to be cleverer.’
The scene in which Charles sells all the old family pictures but his
uncle’s, who is the purchaser in disguise, and that of the discovery of
Lady Teazle when the screen falls, are among the happiest and most
highly wrought that comedy, in its wide and brilliant range, can
boast. Besides the wit and ingenuity of this play, there is a genial
spirit of frankness and generosity about it, that relieves the heart as
well as clears the lungs. It professes a faith in the natural goodness,
as well as habitual depravity of human nature. While it strips off
the mask of hypocrisy, it inspires a confidence between man and man.
As often as it is acted, it must serve to clear the air of that low,
creeping, pestilent fog of cant and mysticism, which threatens to
confound every native impulse, or honest conviction, in the nauseous
belief of a perpetual lie, and the laudable profession of systematic
hypocrisy.—The character of Lady Teazle is not well made out
by the author; nor has it been well represented on the stage since
the time of Miss Farren.—The Rivals is a play of even more action
and incident, but of less wit and satire than the School for Scandal.
It is as good as a novel in the reading, and has the broadest and most
palpable effect on the stage. If Joseph Surface and Charles have a
smack of Tom Jones and Blifil in their moral constitution, Sir
Anthony Absolute and Mrs. Malaprop remind us of honest Matthew
Bramble and his sister Tabitha, in their tempers and dialect. Acres
is a distant descendant of Sir Andrew Ague-cheek. It must be
confessed of this author, as Falstaff says of some one, that ‘he had
damnable iteration in him!’ The Duenna is a perfect work of art.
It has the utmost sweetness and point. The plot, the characters, the
dialogue, are all complete in themselves, and they are all his own;
and the songs are the best that ever were written, except those in the
Beggar’s Opera. They have a joyous spirit of intoxication in them,
and a strain of the most melting tenderness. Compare the softness
of that beginning,</p>

<p class='c014'>It would have been too much for the author of these elegant and
classic productions not to have had some drawbacks on his felicity
and fame. But even the applause of nations and the favour of
princes cannot always be enjoyed with impunity.—Sheridan was not
only an excellent dramatic writer, but a first-rate parliamentary
speaker. His characteristics as an orator were manly, unperverted
good sense, and keen irony. Wit, which has been thought a two-edged
weapon, was by him always employed on the same side of the
question—I think, on the right one. His set and more laboured
speeches, as that on the Begum’s affairs, were proportionably abortive
and unimpressive: but no one was equal to him in replying, on the
spur of the moment, to pompous absurdity, and unravelling the web
of flimsy sophistry. He was the last accomplished debater of the
House of Commons.—His character will, however, soon be drawn
by one who has all the ability, and every inclination to do him
justice; who knows how to bestow praise and to deserve it; by one
who is himself an ornament of private and of public life; a satirist,
beloved by his friends; a wit and a patriot to-boot; a poet, and an
honest man.</p>

<p class='c014'>Macklin’s Man of the World has one powerfully written character,
that of Sir Pertinax Macsycophant, but it required Cooke’s acting
to make it thoroughly effectual.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Holcroft, in his Road to Ruin, set the example of that style
of comedy, in which the <i>slang</i> phrases of jockey-noblemen and the
humours of the four-in-hand club are blended with the romantic
sentiments of distressed damsels and philosophic waiting-maids, and
in which he has been imitated by the most successful of our living
writers, unless we make a separate class for the school of Cumberland,
who was almost entirely devoted to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comédie larmoyante</span></i><a id='t166'></a>, and who,
passing from the light, volatile spirit of his West-Indian to the
mawkish sensibility of the Wheel of Fortune, linked the Muse of
English comedy to the genius of German tragedy, where she has
since remained, like Christabel fallen asleep in the Witch’s arms,
and where I shall leave her, as I have not the poet’s privilege to
break the spell.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are two other writers whom I have omitted to mention, but
not forgotten: they are our two immortal farce-writers, the authors of
the Mayor of Garratt and the Agreeable Surprise. If Foote has
been called our English Aristophanes, O’Keeffe might well be called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>our English Moliere. The scale of the modern writer was smaller,
but the spirit is the same. In light, careless laughter, and pleasant
exaggerations of the humorous, we have had no one equal to him.
There is no labour or contrivance in his scenes, but the drollery of
his subject seems to strike irresistibly upon his fancy, and run away
with his discretion as it does with ours. His Cowslip and Lingo
are Touchstone and Audrey revived. He is himself a Modern
Antique. His fancy has all the quaintness and extravagance of the
old writers, with the ease and lightness which the moderns arrogate
to themselves. All his pieces are delightful, but the Agreeable
Surprise is the most so. There are in this some of the most felicitous
blunders in situation and character that can be conceived; and in
Lingo’s superb replication, ‘A scholar! I was a master of scholars,’
he has hit the height of the ridiculous. Foote had more dry, sarcastic
humour, and more knowledge of the world. His farces are bitter
satires, more or less personal, as it happened. Mother Cole, in the
Minor, and Mr. Smirk the Auctioneer, in Taste, with their coadjutors,
are rich cut-and-come-again, ‘pleasant, though wrong.’ But the Mayor
of Garratt is his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</span></i> in this line. Some comedies are long
farces: this farce is a comedy in little. It is also one of the best
acted farces that we have. The acting of Dowton and Russell, in
Major Sturgeon and Jerry Sneak, cannot be too much praised:
Foote himself would have been satisfied with it. The strut, the
bluster, the hollow swaggering, and turkey-cock swell of the Major;
and Jerry’s meekness, meanness, folly, good-nature, and hen-pecked
air, are assuredly done to the life. The latter character is even better
than the former, which is saying a bold word. Dowton’s art is only
an imitation of art, of an affected or assumed character; but in
Russell’s Jerry you see the very soul of nature, in a fellow that is
‘pigeon-livered and lacks gall,’ laid open and anatomized. You can
see that his heart is no bigger than a pin, and his head as soft as a
pippin. His whole aspect is chilled and frightened, as if he had been
dipped in a pond; and yet he looks as if he would like to be snug
and comfortable, if he durst. He smiles as if he would be friends
with you upon any terms; and the tears come in his eyes because
you will not let him. The tones of his voice are prophetic as the
cuckoo’s under-song. His words are made of water-gruel. The
scene in which he tries to make a confidant of the Major is great;
and his song of ‘Robinson Crusoe’ as melancholy as the island itself.
The reconciliation-scene with his wife, and his exclamation over her,
‘to think that I should make my Molly <i>veep</i>!’ are pathetic, if the
last stage of human infirmity is so. This farce appears to me to be
both moral and entertaining; yet it does not take. It is considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>as an unjust satire on the city, and the country at large; and there is
a very frequent repetition of the word ‘nonsense’ in the house, during
the performance. Mr. Dowton was even hissed, either from the
upper boxes or gallery, in his speech recounting the marching of his
corps ‘from Brentford to Ealing, and from Ealing to Acton;’ and
several persons in the pit, who thought the whole <i>low</i>, were for going
out. This shows well for the progress of civilization. I suppose the
manners described in the Mayor of Garratt have, in the last forty
years, become obsolete, and the characters ideal: we have no longer
either hen-pecked or brutal husbands, or domineering wives; the
Miss Molly Jollops no longer wed Jerry Sneaks, or admire the brave
Major Sturgeons on the other side of Temple-bar; all our soldiers
have become heroes, and our magistrates respectable, and the farce of
life is o’er.</p>

<p class='c014'>One more name, and I have done. It is that of Peter Pindar.
The historian of Sir Joseph Banks and the Emperor of Morocco,
of the Pilgrims and the Peas, of the Royal Academy, and of Mr.
Whitbread’s brewing-vat, the bard in whom the nation and the king
delighted, is old and blind, but still merry and wise:—remembering
how he has made the world laugh in his time, and not repenting of
the mirth he has given; with an involuntary smile lighted up at the
mad pranks of his Muse, and the lucky hits of his pen—‘faint picture
of those flashes of his spirit, that were wont to set the table in a
roar;’ like his own Expiring Taper, bright and fitful to the last;
tagging a rhyme or conning his own epitaph; and waiting for the last
summons, <span class='sc'>Grateful</span> and <span class='sc'>Contented</span>!<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c015'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>I have thus gone through the history of that part of our literature,
which I had proposed to myself to treat of. I have only to add, by
way of explanation, that in some few parts I had anticipated myself
in fugitive or periodical publications; and I thought it better to
repeat what I had already stated to the best of my ability, than alter
it for the worse. These parts bear, however, a very small proportion
to the whole; and I have used such diligence and care as I could, in
adding to them whatever appeared necessary to complete the general
view of the subject, or make it (as far as lay in my power) interesting
to others.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Published in one 8vo volume in 1818 with the following title-page: ‘A View of
the English Stage; or, a Series of Dramatic Criticisms. By William Hazlitt.
“For I am nothing if not critical.” London: Printed for Robert Stodart,
81, Strand; Anderson and Chase, 40, West Smithfield; and Bell and Bradfute,
Edinburgh. 1818.’ The volume was printed by B. M’Millan, Bow Street, Covent
Garden. The work was re-issued in 1821 with a fresh half-title, ‘Dramatic
Criticisms,’ and a fresh title-page bearing the imprint: ‘London: John Warren,
Old Bond-Street, <span class='fss'>MDCCCXXI.</span>’ Selections from the volume have been made and
published along with other dramatic criticisms of Hazlitt’s, but the entire work
has never been republished. See the notes at the end of this volume for particulars
as to these volumes of selections. It is sufficient to state here that the so-called
‘second edition,’ published by the author’s son in 1851 under the title of ‘Criticisms
and Dramatic Essays, of the English Stage,’ contains only a selection from the
essays published in <cite>A View of the English Stage</cite>. The present edition is reprinted
from that of 1818, with the addition of a Table of Contents. For the sake of
convenience the name of the journal from which the essay is taken and the date
of the journal are printed at the beginning of each essay. Hazlitt himself gave the
dates (very inaccurately), but not the names of the journals. In some cases he
gave the name of the theatre at the head of an essay.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>PREFACE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Stage is one great source of public amusement, not to say
instruction. A good play, well acted, passes away a whole evening
delightfully at a certain period of life, agreeably at all times; we
read the account of it next morning with pleasure, and it generally
furnishes one leading topic of conversation for the afternoon. The
disputes on the merits or defects of the last new piece, or of a
favourite performer, are as common, as frequently renewed, and
carried on with as much eagerness and skill, as those on almost any
other subject. Rochefoucault, I believe, it was, who said that the
reason why lovers were so fond of one another’s company was, that
they were always talking about themselves. The same reason almost
might be given for the interest we feel in talking about plays and
players; they are ‘the brief chronicles of the time,’ the epitome of
human life and manners. While we are talking about them, we are
thinking about ourselves. They ‘hold the mirror up to Nature’;
and our thoughts are turned to the Stage as naturally and as fondly as
a fine lady turns to contemplate her face in the glass. It is a glass
too, in which the wise may see themselves; but in which the vain
and superficial see their own virtues, and laugh at the follies of others.
The curiosity which every one has to know how his voice and
manner can be mimicked, must have been remarked or felt by most
of us. It is no wonder then, that we should feel the same sort of
curiosity and interest, in seeing those whose business it is to ‘imitate
humanity’ in general, and who do it sometimes ‘abominably,’ at other
times admirably. Of these, some record is due to the world; but
the player’s art is one that perishes with him, and leaves no traces of
itself, but in the faint descriptions of the pen or pencil. Yet how
eagerly do we stop to look at the prints from Zoffany’s pictures of
Garrick and Weston! How much we are vexed, that so much of
Colley Cibber’s Life is taken up with the accounts of his own
managership, and so little with those inimitable portraits which he
has occasionally given of the actors of his time! How fortunate we
think ourselves, when we can meet with any person who remembers
the principal performers of the last age, and who can give us some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>distant idea of Garrick’s nature, or of an Abington’s grace! We
are always indignant at Smollett, for having introduced a perverse
caricature of the English Roscius, which staggers our faith in his
faultless excellence while reading it. On the contrary, we are pleased
to collect anecdotes of this celebrated actor, which shew his power
over the human heart, and enable us to measure his genius with that
of others by its effects. I have heard, for instance, that once, when
Garrick was acting Lear, the spectators in the front row of the pit,
not being able to see him well in the kneeling scene, where he utters
the curse, rose up, when those behind them, not willing to interrupt
the scene by remonstrating, immediately rose up too, and in this
manner, the whole pit rose up, without uttering a syllable, and so that
you might hear a pin drop. At another time, the crown of straw
which he wore in the same character fell off, or was discomposed,
which would have produced a burst of laughter at any common actor
to whom such an accident had happened; but such was the deep
interest in the character, and such the power of rivetting the attention
possessed by this actor, that not the slightest notice was taken of the
circumstance, but the whole audience remained bathed in silent tears.
The knowledge of circumstances like these, serves to keep alive the
memory of past excellence, and to stimulate future efforts. It was
thought that a work containing a detailed account of the Stage in our
own times—a period not unfruitful in theatrical genius—might not be
wholly without its use.</p>

<p class='c014'>The volume here offered to the public, is a collection of Theatrical
Criticisms which have appeared with little interruption, during the
last four years, in different newspapers—the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, the
<cite>Champion</cite>, the <cite>Examiner</cite>, and lastly, the <cite>Times</cite>. How I came to be
regularly transferred from one of these papers to the other, sometimes
formally and sometimes without ceremony, till I was forced to quit
the last-mentioned by want of health and leisure, would make rather
an amusing story, but that I do not chuse to tell ‘the secrets of the
prison-house.’ I would, however, advise any one who has an
ambition to write, and to write <i>his best</i>, in the periodical press, to
get if possible ‘a situation’ in the <cite>Times</cite> newspaper, the Editor of
which is a man of business, and not of letters. He may write there
as long and as good articles as he can, without being turned out for
it,—unless he should be too prolix on the subject of the Bourbons,
and in that case he may set up an opposition paper on his own
account—as ‘one who loved not wisely but too well.’</p>

<p class='c014'>The first, and (as I think) the best articles in this series, appeared
originally in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>. They are those relating to
Mr. Kean. I went to see him the first night of his appearing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Shylock. I remember it well. The boxes were empty, and the pit
not half full: ‘some quantity of barren spectators and idle renters
were thinly scattered to make up a show.’ The whole presented a
dreary, hopeless aspect. I was in considerable apprehension for the
result. From the first scene in which Mr. Kean came on, my
doubts were at an end. I had been told to give as favourable an
account as I could: I gave a true one. I am not one of those who,
when they see the sun breaking from behind a cloud, stop to ask
others whether it is the moon. Mr. Kean’s appearance was the first
gleam of genius breaking athwart the gloom of the Stage, and the
public have since gladly basked in its ray, in spite of actors, managers,
and critics. I cannot say that my opinion has much changed since
that time. Why should it? I had the same eyes to see with that I
have now, the same ears to hear with, and the same understanding to
judge with. Why then should I not form the same judgment? My
opinions have been sometimes called singular: they are merely
sincere. I say what I think: I think what I feel. I cannot help
receiving certain impressions from things; and I have sufficient
courage to declare (somewhat abruptly) what they are. This is the
only singularity I am conscious of. I do not shut my eyes to
extraordinary merit because I hate it, and refuse to open them till
the clamours of others make me, and then affect to wonder extravagantly
at what I have before affected hypocritically to despise. I do
not make it a common practice, to think nothing of an actor or an
author, because all the world have not pronounced in his favour, and
after they have, to persist in condemning him, as a proof not of
imbecility and ill-nature, but of independence of taste and spirit.
Nor do I endeavour to communicate the infection of my own dulness,
cowardice, and spleen to others, by chilling the coldness of their
constitutions by the poisonous slime of vanity or interest, and setting
up my own conscious inability or unwillingness to form an opinion on
any one subject, as the height of candour and judgment.—I did not
endeavour to persuade Mr. Perry that Mr. Kean was an actor that
would not last, merely because he had not lasted; nor that Miss
Stephens knew nothing of singing, because she had a sweet voice.
On the contrary, I did all I could to counteract the effect of these
safe, not very sound, insinuations, and ‘screw the courage’ of one
principal organ of public opinion ‘to the sticking-place.’ I do not
repent of having done so.</p>

<p class='c014'>With respect to the spirit of partisanship in which the controversy
respecting Mr. Kean’s merits as an actor was carried on, there were
two or three things remarkable. One set of persons, out of the
excess of their unbounded admiration, furnished him with all sorts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>excellences which he did not possess or pretend to, and covered his
defects from the wardrobe of their own fancies. With this class of
persons,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pritchard’s genteel, and Garrick’s six feet high!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I never enlisted in this corps of Swiss bodyguards; I was even
suspected of disloyalty and <i>leze-majesté</i>, because I did not cry out—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand
meme!</span></i>—to all Mr. Kean’s stretches of the prerogatives of
genius, and was placed out of the pale of theatrical orthodoxy, for
not subscribing implicitly to all the articles of belief imposed upon my
senses and understanding. If you had not been to see the little man
twenty times in Richard, and did not deny his being hoarse in the
last act, or admire him for being so, you were looked on as a lukewarm
devotee, or half an infidel. On the other hand, his detractors
constantly argued not from what he was, but from what he was not.
‘He was not tall. He had not a fine voice. He did not play at
Covent-Garden. He was not John Kemble.’ This was all you
could get from them, and this they thought quite sufficient to prove
that he was not any thing, because he was not something quite
different from himself. They did not consider that an actor might
have the eye of an eagle with the voice of a raven, a ‘pigmy body,’
and ‘a fiery soul that o’er-informed its tenement’; that he might
want grace and dignity, and yet have enough nature and passion in
his breast to set up a whole corps of regular stagers. They did not
enquire whether this was the case with respect to Mr. Kean, but
took it for granted that it was not, for no other reason, than because
the question had not been settled by the critics twenty or thirty years
ago, and admitted by the town ever since, that is, before Mr. Kean
was born. A royal infant may be described as ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un haut et puissant
prince, agé d’un jour</span>,’<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c015'><sup>[28]</sup></a> but a great and powerful actor cannot be
known till he arrives at years of discretion, and he must be first a
candidate for theatrical reputation before he can be a veteran. This
is a truism, but it is one that our prejudices constantly make us not
only forget, but frequently combat with all the spirit of martyrdom.
I have (as it will be seen in the following pages) all along spoken
freely of Mr. Kean’s faults, or what I considered such, physical as
well as intellectual; but the balance inclines decidedly to the favourable
side, though not more I think than his merits exceed his defects.
It was also the more necessary to dwell on the claims of an actor to
public support, in proportion as they were original, and to the illiberal
opposition they unhappily had to encounter. I endeavoured to prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>(and with some success), that he was not ‘the very worst actor in
the world.’ His Othello is what appears to me his master-piece.
To those who have seen him in this part, and think little of it, I have
nothing farther to say. It seems to me, as far as the mind alone is
concerned, and leaving the body out of the question, fully equal to
any thing of Mrs. Siddons’s. But I hate such comparisons; and
only make them on strong provocation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Though I do not repent of what I have said in praise of certain
actors, yet I wish I could retract what I have been obliged to say in
reprobation of others. Public reputation is a lottery, in which there
are blanks as well as prizes. The Stage is an arduous profession,
requiring so many essential excellences and accidental advantages,
that though it is an honour and a happiness to succeed in it, it is only
a misfortune, and not a disgrace, to fail in it. Those who put themselves
upon their trial, must, however, submit to the verdict; and the
critic in general does little more than prevent a lingering death, by
anticipating, or putting in immediate force, the sentence of the public.
The victims of criticism, like the victims of the law, bear no good
will to their executioners; and I confess I have often been heartily
tired of so thankless an office. What I have said of any actor, has
never arisen from private pique of any sort. Indeed the only person
on the stage with whom I have ever had any personal intercourse, is
Mr. Liston, and of him I have not spoken ‘with the malice of a
friend.’ To Mr. Conway and Mr. Bartley my apologies are
particularly due: I have accused the one of being tall, and the other
of being fat. I have also said that Mr. Young plays not only like a
scholar, but like ‘a master of scholars’; that Miss O’Neill shines
more in tragedy than comedy; and that Mr. Mathews is an excellent
mimic. I am sorry for these disclosures, which were
extorted from me, but I cannot retract them. There is one observation
which has been made, and which is true, that public censure
hurts actors in a pecuniary point of view; but it has been forgotten,
that public praise assists them in the same manner. Again, I never
understood that the applauded actor thought himself personally obliged
to the newspaper critic; the latter was merely supposed to do his
duty. Why then should the critic be held responsible to the actor
whom he <i>damns</i> by virtue of his office? Besides, as the mimic
caricatures absurdity off the Stage, why should not the critic sometimes
caricature it on the Stage? The children of Momus should
not hold themselves sacred from ridicule. Though the colours may
be a little heightened, the outline may be correct; and truth may be
conveyed, and the public taste improved, by an alliteration or a
quibble that wounds the self-love of an individual. Authors must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>live as well as actors; and the <i>insipid</i> must at all events be avoided
as that which the public abhors most.</p>

<p class='c014'>I am not aware of any thing necessary to be added to this Preface,
but to apologize for some repetitions to be found in the work; I
mean some passages and criticisms that have been transferred to other
publications, such as the account of the Beggar’s Opera, Coriolanus,
&amp;c. In fact, I have come to this determination in my own mind,
that a work is as good as <i>manuscript</i>, and is invested with all the
same privileges, till it appears in a second edition—a rule which leaves
me at liberty to make what use I please of what I have hitherto
written, with the single exception of <span class='sc'>The Characters of Shakespear’s
Plays</span>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean (of whom report had spoken highly) last night made
his appearance at Drury-Lane Theatre in the character of Shylock.
For voice, eye, action, and expression, no actor has come out for
many years at all equal to him. The applause, from the first scene
to the last, was general, loud, and uninterrupted. Indeed, the very
first scene in which he comes on with Bassanio and Antonio, shewed
the master in his art, and at once decided the opinion of the audience.
Perhaps it was the most perfect of any. Notwithstanding the complete
success of Mr. Kean in the part of Shylock, we question whether he
will not become a greater favourite in other parts. There was a
lightness and vigour in his tread, a buoyancy and elasticity of spirit,
a fire and animation, which would accord better with almost any
other character than with the morose, sullen, inward, inveterate,
inflexible malignity of Shylock. The character of Shylock is that
of a man brooding over one idea, that of its wrongs, and bent on one
unalterable purpose, that of revenge. In conveying a profound
impression of this feeling, or in embodying the general conception
of rigid and uncontroulable self-will, equally proof against every
sentiment of humanity or prejudice of opinion, we have seen actors
more successful than Mr. Kean; but in giving effect to the conflict
of passions arising out of the contrasts of situation, in varied vehemence
of declamation, in keenness of sarcasm, in the rapidity of his transitions
from one tone and feeling to another, in propriety and novelty
of action, presenting a succession of striking pictures, and giving
perpetually fresh shocks of delight and surprise, it would be difficult
to single out a competitor. The fault of his acting was (if we may
hazard the objection), an over-display of the resources of the art,
which gave too much relief to the hard, impenetrable, dark groundwork
of the character of Shylock. It would be endless to point
out individual beauties, where almost every passage was received with
equal and deserved applause. We thought, in one or two instances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the pauses in the voice were too long, and too great a reliance placed
on the expression of the countenance, which is a language intelligible
only to a part of the house.</p>

<p class='c014'>The rest of the play was, upon the whole, very respectably cast.
It would be an equivocal compliment to say of Miss Smith, that her
acting often reminds us of Mrs. Siddons. Rae played Bassanio;
but the abrupt and harsh tones of his voice are not well adapted to
the mellifluous cadences of Shakespear’s verse.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean appeared again in Shylock, and by his admirable and
expressive manner of giving the part, fully sustained the reputation
he had acquired by his former representation of it, though he
laboured under the disadvantage of a considerable hoarseness. He
assumed a greater appearance of age and feebleness than on the first
night, but the general merit of his playing was the same. His style
of acting is, if we may use the expression, more significant, more
pregnant with meaning, more varied and alive in every part, than
any we have almost ever witnessed. The character never stands
still; there is no vacant pause in the action; the eye is never silent.
For depth and force of conception, we have seen actors whom we
should prefer to Mr. Kean in Shylock; for brilliant and masterly
execution, none. It is not saying too much of him, though it is
saying a great deal, that he has all that Mr. Kemble <i>wants</i> of
perfection. He reminds us of the descriptions of the ‘far-darting
eye’ of Garrick. We are anxious to see him in Norval and
Richard, and anticipate more complete satisfaction from his performance
of the latter part, than from the one in which he has already
stamped his reputation with the public.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Smith played Portia with much more animation than the
last time we saw her, and in delivering the fine apostrophe on Mercy,
in the trial-scene, was highly impressive.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean’s manner of acting this part has one peculiar advantage;
it is entirely his own, without any traces of imitation of any other
actor. He stands upon his own ground, and he stands firm upon it.
Almost every scene had the stamp and freshness of nature. The
excellences and defects of his performance were in general the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>as those which he discovered in Shylock; though, as the character
of Richard is the most difficult, so we think he displayed most power
in it. It is possible to form a higher conception of this character
(we do not mean from seeing other actors, but from reading
Shakespear) than that given by this very admirable tragedian;
but we cannot imagine any character represented with greater
distinctness and precision, more perfectly <i>articulated</i> in every part.
Perhaps, indeed, there is too much of this; for we sometimes thought
he failed, even from an exuberance of talent, and dissipated the
impression of the character by the variety of his resources. To be
perfect, it should have a little more solidity, depth, sustained, and
impassioned feeling, with somewhat less brilliancy, with fewer
glancing lights, pointed transitions, and pantomimic evolutions.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Richard of Shakespear is towering and lofty, as well as
aspiring; equally impetuous and commanding; haughty, violent,
and subtle; bold and treacherous; confident in his strength, as
well as in his cunning; raised high by his birth, and higher by his
genius and his crimes; a royal usurper, a princely hypocrite, a tyrant,
and a murderer of the House of Plantagenet.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘But I was born so high;</div>
      <div class='line'>Our airy buildeth in the cedar’s top,</div>
      <div class='line'>And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The idea conveyed in these lines (which are omitted in the
miserable medley acted for Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span>) is never lost sight of by
Shakespear, and should not be out of the actor’s mind for a moment.
The restless and sanguinary Richard is not a man striving to be
great, but to be greater than he is; conscious of his strength of
will, his powers of intellect, his daring courage, his elevated station,
and making use of these advantages, as giving him both the means
and the pretext to commit unheard-of crimes, and to shield himself
from remorse and infamy.</p>

<p class='c014'>If Mr. Kean does not completely succeed in concentrating all the
lines of the character, as drawn by Shakespear, he gives an animation,
vigour, and relief to the part, which we have never seen surpassed.
He is more refined than Cooke; more bold, varied, and original
than Kemble, in the same character. In some parts, however, we
thought him deficient in dignity; and particularly in the scenes of
state business, there was not a sufficient air of artificial authority.
The fine assumption of condescending superiority, after he is made
king—‘Stand all apart—Cousin of Buckingham,’ &amp;c. was not given
with the effect which it might have received. There was also at
times, a sort of tip-toe elevation, an enthusiastic rapture in his expectations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>of obtaining the crown, instead of a gloating expression of
sullen delight, as if he already clutched the bauble, and held it
within his grasp. This was the precise expression which Mr. Kean
gave with so much effect to the part where he says, that he already
feels</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The golden rigol bind his brows.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In one who <i>dares</i> so much, there is little indeed to blame. The
only two things which appeared to us decidedly objectionable, were
the sudden letting down of his voice when he says of Hastings, ‘chop
off his head,’ and the action of putting his hands behind him, in
listening to Buckingham’s account of his reception by the citizens.
His courtship scene with Lady Anne was an admirable exhibition
of smooth and smiling villainy. The progress of wily adulation, of
encroaching humility, was finely marked throughout by the action,
voice, and eye. He seemed, like the first tempter, to approach his
prey, certain of the event, and as if success had smoothed the way
before him. We remember Mr. Cooke’s manner of representing
this scene was more violent, hurried, and full of anxious uncertainty.
This, though more natural in general, was, we think, less in character.
Richard should woo not as a lover, but as an actor—to shew his
mental superiority, and power to make others the playthings of his
will. Mr. Kean’s attitude in leaning against the side of the stage
before he comes forward in this scene, was one of the most graceful
and striking we remember to have seen. It would have done for
Titian to paint. The opening scene in which Richard descants on his
own deformity, was conceived with perfect truth and character, and
delivered in a fine and varied tone of natural recitation. Mr. Kean
did equal justice to the beautiful description of the camps the night
before the battle, though, in consequence of his hoarseness, he was
obliged to repeat the whole passage in an under-key.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c015'><sup>[29]</sup></a> His manner of
bidding his friends good night, and his pausing with the point of his
sword, drawn slowly backward and forward on the ground, before he
retires to his tent, received shouts of applause. He gave to all the
busy scenes of the play the greatest animation and effect. He filled
every part of the stage. The concluding scene, in which he is killed
by Richmond, was the most brilliant. He fought like one drunk
with wounds: and the attitude in which he stands with his hands
stretched out, after his sword is taken from him, had a preternatural
and terrific grandeur, as if his will could not be disarmed, and the
very phantoms of his despair had a withering power.</p>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>February 21, 1814.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The house was crowded at an early hour in every part, to witness
Mr. Kean’s second representation of Richard. His admirable acting
received that meed of applause, which it so well deserved. His
voice had not entirely recovered its tone and strength; and when
(after the curtain had dropped, amidst a tumult of approbation), Mr.
Rae came forward to announce the play for Monday, cries of ‘No,
no,’ from every part of the house, testified the sense entertained by
the audience, of the impropriety of requiring the repetition of this
extraordinary effort, till every physical disadvantage had been completely
removed.</p>

<p class='c014'>We have little to add to our former remarks, for Mr. Kean went
through the part nearly as before, and we saw no reason to alter our
opinion. The dying scene was the most varied, and, we think, for
the worse. In pronouncing the words in Richard’s soliloquy, ‘I am
myself alone,’ Mr. Kean gave a quick and hurried movement to his
voice, as if it was a thought that suddenly struck him, or which he
wished to pass over; whereas it is the deep and rooted sentiment of
his breast. The reduplication of the words in Shakespear points out
the manner in which the voice should dwell upon, and as it were,
brood over the feeling, loth to part with the bitter consolation.
Where he says to Buckingham, ‘I am not i’ the vein,’ the expression
should, we imagine, be that of stifled hatred, and cold contempt,
instead of sarcastic petulance. The scene tells for itself, without
being pointed by the manner. In general, perhaps, if Mr. Kean were
to give to the character less of the air of an ostentatious hypocrite,
of an intelligible villain, it would be more correct, and would accord
better with Shakespear’s idea of the part. The description which he
has put into the mouth of Hastings, is a perfect study for the actor.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning:</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s some conceit or other likes him well,</div>

      <div class='line'>I think there’s ne’er a man in Christendom</div>
      <div class='line'>Can lesser hide his hate or love than he,</div>
      <div class='line'>For by his face straight shall you know his heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the scene with Lady Anne, in the sudden alteration of his
manner to the messenger who brings him the news of Edward’s
illness, in the interview with Buckingham, where he desires the death
of the children, in his infinitely spirited expostulation with Lord
Stanley, in his triumph at the death of Buckingham, in the parting
scene with his friends before the battle, in his treatment of the paper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>sent to Norfolk, and in all the tumult and glowing interest of the last
scenes of the play, we had fresh cause for admiration. It were in vain,
however, to point out particular beauties; for the research, the
ingenuity, and the invention manifested throughout the character are
endless. We have said before, and we still think so, that there is
even too much effect given, too many significant hints, too much
appearance of study. There is a tone in acting, as well as in painting,
which is the chief and master excellence. Our highest conception
of an actor is, that he shall assume the character once for all, and be
it throughout, and trust to this conscious sympathy for the effect
produced. Mr. Kean’s manner of acting is, on the contrary, rather
a perpetual assumption of his part, always brilliant and successful,
almost always true and natural, but yet always a distinct effort in
every new situation, so that the actor does not seem entirely to forget
himself, or to be identified with the character. The extreme elaboration
of the parts injures the broad and massy effect; the general
impulse of the machine is retarded by the variety and intricacy of the
movements. But why do we try this actor by an ideal theory?
Who is there that will stand the same test? It is, in fact, the last
forlorn hope of criticism, for it shews that we have nothing else to
compare him with. ‘Take him for all in all,’ it will be long, very
long, before we ‘look upon his like again,’ if we are to wait as long
as we <i>have</i> waited.</p>

<p class='c014'>We wish the introduction of the ghosts through the trap-doors of
the stage were altogether omitted. The speeches, which they address
to Richard, might be delivered just as well from behind the scenes.
These sort of exhibitions are only proper for a superstitious age; and
in an age not superstitious, excite ridicule instead of terror. Mr.
Wroughton makes a very substantial ghost, and Miss Boyce retains
the same ruddy appearance of flesh and blood, and the same graceful
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i>, which so well became her in the scene where she was
wooed by Richard. Mrs. Glover’s Queen was more natural and
impressive than on the first night, because it was less turbulent; and
if she would use still less vociferation, she would produce a still
greater effect—‘For in the very torrent and whirlwind of the passion,
you should acquire a temperance that may give it smoothness.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean’s acting in Richard, as we before remarked in his
Shylock, presents a perpetual succession of striking pictures. He
bids fair to supply us with the best Shakespear Gallery we have had!</p>

<div class='c026'><i>March 14, 1814.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>That which distinguishes the dramatic productions of Shakespear
from all others, is the wonderful variety and perfect individuality of
his characters. Each of these is as much itself, and as absolutely
independent of the rest, as if they were living persons, not fictions of
the mind. The poet appears for the time being, to be identified with
the character he wishes to represent, and to pass from one to the
other, like the same soul, successively animating different bodies. By
an art like that of the ventriloquist, he throws his imagination out of
himself, and makes every word appear to proceed from the very
mouth of the person whose name it bears. His plays alone are
properly expressions of the passions, not descriptions of them. His
characters are real beings of flesh and blood; they speak like men,
not like authors. One might suppose that he had stood by at the
time, and had overheard what passed. Each object and circumstance
seems to exist in his mind as it existed in nature; each several train
of thought and feeling goes on of itself without effort or confusion;
in the world of his imagination every thing has a life, a place and
being of its own.</p>

<p class='c014'>These remarks are, we think, as applicable to Hamlet, as to any
of Shakespear’s tragedies. It is, if not the finest, perhaps the most
inimitable of all his productions. Lear is first, for the profound
intensity of the passion: Macbeth, for the wildness of the imagination,
and the glowing rapidity of the action: Othello, for the progressive
interest, and rapid alternations of feeling: Hamlet, for perfect
dramatic truth, and the unlooked-for development of sentiment and
character. Shakespear has in this play shewn more of the magnanimity
of genius, than in any other. There is no attempt to force an
interest, but every thing is left to time and circumstances. The
interest is excited without premeditation or effort, the events succeed
each other as matters of course, the characters think, and speak and
act just as they would do, if they were left to themselves. The
whole play is an exact transcript of what might have taken place at
the Court of Denmark five hundred years ago, before the modern
refinements in morality and manners.</p>

<p class='c014'>The character of Hamlet is itself a pure effusion of genius. It is
not a character marked by strength of passion or will, but by refinement
of thought and feeling. Hamlet is as little of the hero as a man
can well be; but he is ‘a young and princely novice,’ full of high
enthusiasm and quick sensibility—the sport of circumstances, questioning
with fortune, and refining on his own feelings, and forced from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>natural bias of his character, by the strangeness of his situation.
He seems incapable of deliberate action, and is only hurried into
extremities on the spur of the occasion, when he has no time to
reflect, as in the scene where he kills Polonius, and where he alters
the letters which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern take with them. At
other times, he remains puzzled, undecided, and sceptical, dallies with
his purposes till the occasion is lost, and always finds some reason to
relapse into indolence and thoughtfulness again. For this reason he
refuses to kill the King when he is at his prayers, and by a refinement
in malice, which is only an excuse for his own want of resolution,
defers his revenge to some more fatal opportunity, when he shall be
engaged in some act ‘that has no relish of salvation in it.’ So he
scruples to trust the suggestions of the Ghost, contrives the scene of
the play to have surer proof of his uncle’s guilt, and then rests
satisfied with this confirmation of his suspicions, and the success of
his experiment, instead of acting upon it. The moral perfection of
this character has been called in question. It is more natural than
conformable to rules; and if not more amiable, is certainly more
dramatic on that account. Hamlet is not, to be sure, a Sir Charles
Grandison. In general, there is little of the drab-coloured quakerism
of morality in the ethical delineations of ‘that noble and liberal
casuist,’ as Shakespear has been well called. He does not set his
heroes in the stocks of virtue, to make mouths at their own situation.
His plays are not transcribed from the Whole Duty of Man! We
confess, we are a little shocked at the want of refinement in those,
who are shocked at the want of refinement in Hamlet. The want of
punctilious exactness of behaviour either partakes of the ‘license of
the time,’ or belongs to the very excess of intellectual refinement in
the character, which makes the common rules of life, as well as his
own purposes, sit loose upon him. He may be said to be amenable
only to the tribunal of his own thoughts, and is too much occupied
with the airy world of contemplation, to lay as much stress as he
ought on the practical consequences of things. His habitual
principles of action are unhinged, and ‘out of joint’ with the
time.</p>

<p class='c014'>This character is probably of all others the most difficult to
personate on the stage. It is like the attempt to embody a shadow.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Come then, the colours and the ground prepare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chuse a firm cloud, before it falls, and in it</div>
      <div class='line'>Catch, ‘ere she change, the Cynthia of a minute.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Such nearly is the task which the actor imposes on himself in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>part of Hamlet. It is quite remote from hardness and dry precision.
The character is spun to the finest thread, yet never loses its continuity.
It has the yielding flexibility of ‘a wave of the sea.’ It is
made up of undulating lines, without a single sharp angle. There is
no set purpose, no straining at a point. The observations are
suggested by the passing scene—the gusts of passion come and go,
like the sounds of music borne on the wind. The interest depends
not on the action, but on the thoughts—on ‘that within which passeth
shew.’ Yet, in spite of these difficulties, Mr. Kean’s representation
of the character had the most brilliant success. It did not indeed
come home to our feelings, as Hamlet (that very Hamlet whom we
read of in our youth, and seem almost to remember in our after-years),
but it was a most striking and animated rehearsal of the
part.</p>

<p class='c014'>High as Mr. Kean stood in our opinion before, we have no
hesitation in saying, that he stands higher in it (and, we think, will
in that of the public), from the powers displayed in this last effort.
If it was less perfect as a whole, there were parts in it of a higher
cast of excellence than any part of his Richard. We will say at
once, in what we think his general delineation of the character wrong.
It was too strong and pointed. There was often a severity,
approaching to virulence, in the common observations and answers.
There is nothing of this in Hamlet. He is, as it were, wrapped up
in the cloud of his reflections, and only <i>thinks aloud</i>. There should
therefore be no attempt to impress what he says upon others by any
exaggeration of emphasis or manner, no talking <i>at</i> his hearers.
There should be as much of the gentleman and scholar as possible
infused into the part, and as little of the actor. A pensive air of
sadness should sit unwillingly upon his brow, but no appearance of
fixed and sullen gloom. He is full of ‘weakness and melancholy,’
but there is no harshness in his nature. Hamlet should be the most
amiable of misanthropes. There is no one line in this play, which
should be spoken like any one line in Richard; yet Mr. Kean did
not appear to us to keep the two characters always distinct. He was
least happy in the last scene with Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.
In some of these more familiar scenes he displayed more energy than
was requisite; and in others where it would have been appropriate,
did not rise equal to the exigency of the occasion. In particular, the
scene with Laertes, where he leaps into the grave, and utters the
exclamation, ‘’Tis I, Hamlet the Dane,’ had not the tumultuous and
overpowering effect we expected from it. To point out the defects
of Mr. Kean’s performance of the part, is a less grateful but a much
shorter task, than to enumerate the many striking beauties which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>gave to it, both by the power of his action and by the true feeling of
nature. His surprise when he first sees the Ghost, his eagerness and
filial confidence in following it, the impressive pathos of his action and
voice in addressing it, ‘I’ll call thee Hamlet, <i>Father</i>, Royal Dane,’
were admirable.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean has introduced in this part a <i>new reading</i>, as it is called,
which we think perfectly correct. In the scene where he breaks
from his friends to obey the command of his father, he keeps his
sword pointed behind him, to prevent them from following him,
instead of holding it before him to protect him from the Ghost.
The manner of his taking Guildenstern and Rosencrantz under each
arm, under pretence of communicating his secret to them, when he
only means to trifle with them, had the finest effect, and was, we
conceive, exactly in the spirit of the character. So was the suppressed
tone of irony in which he ridicules those who gave ducats for his
uncle’s picture, though they would ‘make mouths at him,’ while his
father lived. Whether the way in which Mr. Kean hesitates in
repeating the first line of the speech in the interview with the player,
and then, after several ineffectual attempts to recollect it, suddenly
hurries on with it, ‘The rugged Pyrrhus,’ &amp;c. is in perfect keeping,
we have some doubts: but there was great ingenuity in the thought;
and the spirit and life of the execution was beyond every thing.
Hamlet’s speech in describing his own melancholy, his instructions to
the players, and the soliloquy on death, were all delivered by Mr.
Kean in a tone of fine, clear, and natural recitation. His pronunciation
of the word ‘contumely’ in the last of these, is, we apprehend, not
authorized by custom, or by the metre.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both the closet scene with his mother, and his remonstrances to
Ophelia, were highly impressive. If there had been less vehemence
of effort in the latter, it would not have lost any of its effect. But
whatever nice faults might be found in this scene, they were amply
redeemed by the manner of his coming back after he has gone to the
extremity of the stage, from a pang of parting tenderness to press his
lips to Ophelia’s hand. It had an electrical effect on the house. It
was the finest commentary that was ever made on Shakespear. It
explained the character at once (as he meant it), as one of disappointed
hope, of bitter regret, of affection suspended, not obliterated,
by the distractions of the scene around him! The manner in which
Mr. Kean acted in the scene of the Play before the King and Queen
was the most daring of any, and the force and animation which he
gave to it, cannot be too highly applauded. Its extreme boldness
‘bordered on the verge of all we hate,’ and the effect it produced,
was a test of the extraordinary powers of this extraordinary actor.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>We cannot speak too highly of Mr. Raymond’s representation of
the Ghost. It glided across the stage with the preternatural grandeur
of a spirit. His manner of speaking the part was not equally
excellent. A spirit should not whine or shed tears.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Dowton’s Polonius was unworthy of so excellent an actor.
The part was mistaken altogether. Polonius is not exceedingly
wise, but he is not quite a fool; or if he is, he is at the same time a
courtier, and a courtier of the old school. Mr. Dowton made
nothing, or worse than nothing, of the part.</p>

Mr. Kean. His success was fully equal to the arduousness of the
undertaking. In general, we might observe that he displayed the

His voice and person were not altogether in consonance with the
character, nor was there throughout, that noble tide of deep and
sustained passion, impetuous, but majestic, that ‘flows on to the
Propontic, and knows no ebb,’ which raises our admiration and pity
of the lofty-minded Moor. There were, however, repeated bursts of
feeling and energy which we have never seen surpassed. The whole
of the latter part of the third act was a master-piece of profound
pathos and exquisite conception, and its effect on the house was
electrical. The tone of voice in which he delivered the beautiful
apostrophe, ‘Then, oh farewell!’ struck on the heart and the
imagination like the swelling notes of some divine music. The look,
the action, the expression of voice, with which he accompanied the
exclamation, ‘Not a jot, not a jot;’ the reflection, ‘I felt not
<i>Cassio’s kisses</i> on her lips;’ and his vow of revenge against Cassio,
and abandonment of his love for Desdemona, laid open the very
tumult and agony of the soul. In other parts, where we expected an
equal interest to be excited, we were disappointed; and in the
common scenes, we think Mr. Kean’s manner, as we have remarked
on other occasions, had more point and emphasis than the sense or
character required.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c015'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>The rest of the play was by no means judiciously cast; indeed,

<p class='c014'>The part of Iago was played at Drury-Lane on Saturday by Mr.
Kean, and played with admirable facility and effect. It was the most
faultless of his performances, the most consistent and entire. Perhaps
the accomplished hypocrite was never so finely, so adroitly pourtrayed—a
gay, light-hearted monster, a careless, cordial, comfortable
villain. The preservation of character was so complete, the air and
manner were so much of a piece throughout, that the part seemed
more like a detached scene or single <i>trait</i>, and of shorter duration
than it usually does. The ease, familiarity, and tone of nature with
which the text was delivered, were quite equal to any thing we have
seen in the best comic acting. It was the least overdone of all his
parts, though full of point, spirit, and brilliancy. The odiousness of
the character was in fact, in some measure, glossed over by the
extreme grace, alacrity and rapidity of the execution. Whether this
effect were ‘a consummation of the art devoutly to be wished,’ is
another question, on which we entertain some doubts. We have
already stated it as our opinion, that Mr. Kean is not a literal
transcriber of his author’s text; he translates his characters with
great freedom and ingenuity into a language of his own; but at the
same time we cannot help preferring his liberal and spirited dramatic
versions, to the dull, literal, common-place monotony of his competitors.
Besides, after all, in the conception of the part, he may be
right, and we may be wrong. We have before complained that Mr.
Kean’s Richard was not gay enough, and we should now be disposed
to complain that his Iago is not grave enough.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Sowerby’s Othello, we are sorry to add, was a complete
failure, and the rest of the play was very ill got up.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Nov. 16, 1813.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Shakespear’s tragedy of Antony and Cleopatra was brought out
last night at Covent-Garden with alterations, and with considerable
additions from Dryden’s All for Love. The piece seems to have
been in some measure got up for the occasion, as there are several
claptraps in the speeches, which admit of an obvious allusion to
passing characters and events, and which were eagerly seized by the
audience. Of the execution of the task which the compiler has
imposed upon himself, we cannot speak in terms of much praise.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Almost all the transpositions of passages which he has attempted, are,
we think, injudicious and injurious to the effect. Thus the rich and
poetical description of the person of Cleopatra, in the beginning of the
second act—‘The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne, burnt on
the water,’ &amp;c. which prepares the way for, and almost seems to
justify the subsequent infatuation of Antony, is here postponed till
near the catastrophe, where it answers no end, and excites little
interest. It would also have been much better, if the author had
contented himself merely with omitting certain passages, which he
might deem objectionable to a modern audience, without encumbering
either the plot or dialogue with any foreign interpolation. He might
have separated the gold of Shakespear from the alloy which at times
accompanies it, but he ought not to have mixed it up with the heavy
tinsel of Dryden. We cannot approve of the attempt to effect ‘an
amalgamation of the wonderful powers’ of these writers, who are, in
the preface to the printed play, classed together as ‘two of England’s
greatest poets.’ There is not the slightest comparison between them,
either in kind or degree. There is all the difference between them,
that can subsist between artificial and natural passion. Dryden never
goes out of himself: he is a man of strong sense and powerful feeling,
reasoning upon what he should feel in certain situations, and expressing
himself in studied declamation, in general topics, expanding and
varying the stock of his own ideas, so as to produce a tolerable
resemblance to those of mankind in different situations, and building
up, by the aid of logic and rhetoric—that is, by means of certain
truths and images, generally known and easily applied, a stately and
impressive poem. Whereas Shakespear does not suppose himself to
be others, but at once <i>becomes</i> them. His imagination passes out of
himself into them, and as it were, transmits to him their feelings and
circumstances. Nothing is made out by inference and analogy, by
climax and antithesis, but all comes immediately from nature—the
thoughts, the images, the very words are hers. His plays can only
be compared with Nature—they are unlike every thing else.</p>

<p class='c014'>Antony and Cleopatra, though not in the first order of Shakespear’s
productions, is one of the best of his historical plays. It is every
where full of that pervading comprehensive power, by which the poet
seemed to identify himself with time and nature. The pomp and
voluptuous charms of Cleopatra are displayed in all their force and
lustre, as well as the effeminate grandeur of the soul of Mark Antony.
The repentance of Enobarbus after his treachery to his master, the
most beautiful and affecting part of the play, is here, for some reason,
entirely omitted. Nothing can have more local truth and perfect
character than the passage in which Cleopatra is represented as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>conjecturing what were the employments of Antony in his absence.
‘He’s speaking now, or murmuring—where’s my serpent of old
Nile?’ Or again, when she says to Antony, after the defeat of
Actium, and his resolution to risk another fight—‘It is my birth-day;
I had thought to have held it poor, but since my Lord is Antony
again, I will be Cleopatra.’ The transition, in the present compilation,
from these flashes of genius which lay open the inmost soul,
to the forced mechanical style and architectural dialogue of Dryden,
is abrupt and painful.</p>

<p class='c014'>The play was got up with every advantage of external pomp and
decoration. Mr. Young, as Mark Antony, exhibited a just and
impressive picture of the Roman hero, struggling between the dictates
of his love and honour. Mrs. M’Gibbon was a respectable and
interesting representative of Octavia. Mrs. Faucit’s Cleopatra conveyed
at least a reflex image of the voluptuous magnificence of the
Queen of Egypt. In the ironical scenes with Antony, her manner
sometimes bordered too much on the affected levity of a modern fine
lady, and wanted the passion and dignity of the enamoured and
haughty sovereign. In the part of Ventidius, we are sorry to say,
that we think Mr. Terry was by no means successful. His manner
had all the turbulent ferocity of a gloomy savage, none of the lofty
firmness of the Roman Senator. The expression of the passion was
every where too coarse and too physical; his muscles assumed a
preternatural rigidity, and the mode in which he articulated every
sentence was distinct, almost to dislocation. The house, however,
seemed to be of a different opinion; for, in the several scenes with
Mr. Young, he was loudly and tumultuously applauded.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Stephens made her appearance again on Saturday at Covent-Garden,
as Mandane, in Artaxerxes. She becomes more and more
a favourite with the public. Her singing is delicious; but admired as
it is, it is not yet admired as it ought to be. Oh, if she had been
wafted to us from Italy!—A voice more sweet, varied, and flexible,
was perhaps never heard on an English stage. In ‘The Soldier
tired,’ her voice, though it might be said to cleave the very air, never
once lost its sweetness and clearness. ‘Let not rage thy bosom
firing’ was deservedly and rapturously encored. But if we were to
express a preference, it would be to her singing the lines, ‘What was
my pride is now my shame,’ &amp;c. in which the notes seemed to fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>from her lips like the liquid drops from the bending flower, and her
voice fluttered and died away with the expiring conflict of passion in
her bosom. We know, and have felt the divine power and
impassioned tones of Catalani—the lightning of her voice and of her
eye—but we doubt whether she would give the ballad style of the
songs in Artaxerxes, simple but elegant, chaste but full of expression,
with equal purity, taste, and tenderness.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Liston’s acting in Love, Law, and Physic, was as excellent
as it always is. It is hard to say, whether the soul of Mr. Liston
has passed into Mr. Lubin Log, or that of Mr. Lubin Log into Mr.
Liston:—but a most wonderful congeniality and mutual good understanding
there is between them. A more perfect personation we
never witnessed. The happy compound of meanness, ignorance,
vulgarity, and conceit, was given with the broadest effect, and with
the nicest discrimination of feeling. Moliere would not have wished
for a richer representative of his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gentilhomme Bourgeois</span></cite>. We insist
the more on this point, because of all imitations we like the imitation
of nature best. The marked <i>cockneyism</i> of pronouncing the V for
the W, was the only circumstance to which we could object, and this
is an interpolation on the part since we first saw it, suggested (we
suppose) by friends. It is a hackneyed and cheap way of producing
a laugh, unworthy of the true comic genius of Liston.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Oct. 23, 1813.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Beggar’s Opera was acted at Covent-Garden last night, for
the purpose of introducing Miss Stephens in the character of Polly.
The play itself is among the most popular of our dramas, and one
which the public are always glad to have some new excuse for seeing
acted again. Its merits are peculiarly its own. It not only delights,
but instructs us, without our knowing how, and though it is at first
view equally offensive to good taste and common decency. The
materials, indeed, of which it is composed, the scenes, characters, and
incidents, are in general of the lowest and most disgusting kind; but
the author, by the sentiments and reflections which he has put into
the mouths of highwaymen, turnkeys, their wives and daughters, has
converted the motley group into a set of fine gentlemen and ladies,
satirists, and philosophers. What is still more extraordinary, he has
effected this transformation without once violating probability, or
‘o’erstepping the modesty of nature.’ In fact, Gay has in this
instance turned the tables on the critics; and by the assumed license
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of the mock-heroic style, has enabled himself to <i>do justice to nature</i>,
that is, to give all the force, truth, and locality of real feeling to the
thoughts and expressions, without being called to the bar of false
taste, and affected delicacy. We might particularly refer to Polly’s
description of the death of her lover, and to the song, ‘Woman is
like the fair flower in its lustre,’ the extreme beauty and feeling of
which are only equalled by their characteristic propriety and <i>naivete</i>.
Every line of this sterling Comedy sparkles with wit, and is fraught
with the keenest and bitterest invective.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been said by a great moralist, ‘There is some soul of
goodness in things evil;’ and The Beggar’s Opera is a good-natured,
but severe comment on this text. The poet has thrown all the
gaiety and sunshine of the imagination, the intoxication of pleasure,
and the vanity of despair, round the short-lived existence of his
heroes, while Peachum and Lockitt are seen in the back ground,
parcelling out their months and weeks between them. The general
view of human life is of the most refined and abstracted kind. With
the happiest art, the author has brought out the good qualities and
interesting emotions almost inseparable from humanity in the lowest
situations, and with the same penetrating glance, has detected the
disguises which rank and circumstance lend to exalted vice. It may
be said that the moral of the piece (which some respectable critics
have been at a loss to discover), <i>is to shew the vulgarity of vice</i>; or
that the sophisms with which the great and powerful palliate their
violations of integrity and decorum, are, in fact, common to them
with the vilest, most abandoned and contemptible of the species.
What can be more galling than the arguments used by these would-be
politicians, to prove that in hypocrisy, selfishness, and treachery,
they are far behind some of their betters? The exclamation of
Mrs. Peachum, when her daughter marries Macheath, ‘Hussey,
hussey, you will be as ill used and as much neglected as if you had
married a Lord,’ is worth all Miss Hannah More’s laboured invectives
on the laxity of the manners of high life!</p>

<p class='c014'>The innocent and amiable Polly found a most interesting representative
in Miss Stephens. Her acting throughout was simple,
unaffected, graceful, and full of tenderness. Her tones in speaking,
though low, and suited to the gentleness of the character, were
distinct, and varied with great flexibility. She will lose by her
performance of this part, none of the reputation she has gained in
Mandane. The manner in which she gave the song in the first act,
‘But he so teazed me,’ &amp;c. was sweetness itself: the notes undulated
through the house, amidst murmurs of rapturous applause. She gave
equal animation and feeling to the favourite air, ‘Cease your funning.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>To this, however, as well as to some other of the songs, a more
dramatic effect might perhaps be given. There is a severity of
feeling, and a plaintive sadness, both in the words and music of the
songs in this Opera, on which too much stress cannot be laid.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Oct. 30.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Miss Stephens made her appearance again last night at Covent-Garden,
in Polly, with additional lustre. Her timidity was overcome,
and her voice was exerted in all its force and sweetness. We
find so much real taste, elegance, and feeling, in this very delightful
singer, that we cannot help repeating our praise of her, though,
perhaps, by so doing, we shall only irritate the sullen fury of certain
formidable critics, at the appearance of a new favourite of the public.
We are aware that there is a class of connoisseurs whose envy it
might be prudent to disarm, by some compromise with their perverted
taste; who are horror-struck at grace and beauty, and who can only
find relief and repose in the consoling thoughts of deformity and
defect; whose blood curdles into poison at deserved reputation, who
shudder at every temptation <i>to admire</i>, as an unpardonable crime, and
shrink from whatever gives delight to others, with more than monkish
self-denial. These kind of critics are well described by Molière, as
displaying, on all occasions, an invincible hatred for what the rest of
the world admire, and an inconceivable partiality for those perfections
which none but themselves can discover. The secret both of their
affection and enmity is the same—their pride is mortified with
whatever can give pleasure, and soothed with what excites only pity
or indifference. They search out with scrupulous malice, the smallest
defect or excess of every kind: it is only when it becomes painfully
oppressive to every one else, that they are reconciled to it. A critic
of this order is dissatisfied with the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i> of Miss Stephens;
while his eye reposes with perfect self-complacency on the little round
graces of Mrs. Liston’s person!</p>

<p class='c014'>Richard Cœur de Lion was brought out last night at Covent-Garden,
in which Miss Stephens made her appearance in the character
of Matilda. She looked and spoke the part well, but the favourite
pathetic air of ‘Oh, Richard! oh, my love,’ was omitted, we suppose
in consequence of indisposition.</p>

<p class='c014'>The new farce, called ‘Tricking’s fair in Love,’ followed, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>with little success; for after being heard out with great fairness, it
was decidedly condemned at last, notwithstanding some inimitable
acting by Liston as Count Hottentot. We never saw his face in a
state of higher keeping. It was quite rich and unctuous.</p>

<p class='c014'>A young lady (Miss Foote) afterwards made her first appearance
in Amanthis. Her face and figure excited the liveliest interest as
soon as she appeared; which her manner of executing the part did
not diminish, but increased as she proceeded. Her voice possesses
great clearness and sweetness, and her enunciation is exceedingly
distinct and articulate, without any appearance of labour. Her
features are soft and regular. She perfectly answered to the idea
which we form of youth, beauty, grace, and artless innocence in the
original character. She seemed to be, indeed, the Child of Nature,

<p class='c014'>The Opera closed for the season on Saturday last. We attended
on this farewell occasion, without any strong feelings of regret for the
past, or of sanguine expectations for the future. The Opera, from
its constant and powerful appeals to the senses, by imagery, by sound,
and motion, is well calculated to amuse or stimulate the intellectual
languor of those classes of society, on whose support it immediately
depends. This is its highest aim, and its appropriate use. But,
without the aid of luxurious pomp, what can there be to interest in
this merely artificial vehicle of show, and dance, and song, which is
purposely constructed so as to lull every effort of the understanding
and feeling of the heart in the soft, soothing effeminacy of sensual
enjoyment? The Opera Muse is not a beautiful virgin who can hope
to charm by simplicity and sensibility; but a tawdry courtesan, who,
when her paint and patches, her rings and jewels are stripped off, can
excite only disgust and ridicule. This is the state to which she has
been reduced by dissentions among her keepers for the last season.—Nothing
could be more unpleasant than the impression produced on
our minds by the exhibition of Saturday last. Tattered hanging
fragments of curtains, disjointed machinery, silver pannels turned
black, a few thinly scattered lamps badly lighted, were among the
various circumstances which threw a damp over our spirits. Bankruptcy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>every where stared us in the face. The general <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œil</span></i> of
the theatre had no affinity with gaiety or grandeur. The whole had
the melancholy appearance, without any of the sublimity, of some
relic of eastern magnificence.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Opera was Didone Abandonnata, in which Madame Grassini
performed the part of the unfortunate Queen, and Signor Tramezzani
(appearing for the last time on the English stage), that of the faithless
Æneas. During the greater part of the first act, there was hardly
any body in the pit, and nobody in the boxes. The performance
evidently partook of the apathy of the public. We do not know
otherwise how to account for the undress manner in which Madame
Grassini acted the part of Dido. She walked through it with the
most perfect indifference, or as if she had been at a morning rehearsal
before empty benches. The graceful dignity of the character never
left her, but it was the habitual grace of a queen surrounded by her
maids of honour, not the impassioned energy of a queen enamoured of
the son of a goddess, and courted by Numidian kings. Even after
the desertion of Æneas, and when the flames of her capital were
surrounding her, the terror and agitation she displayed did not amount
to the anxiety of a common assignation-scene; her trills and quavers
very artfully mimicked the uncertain progress of the tremulous flames;
and she at last left the stage, not as if rushing in an agony of despair
to her fate, but with the hurry and alarm of a person who is afraid of
being detected in a clandestine correspondence. In some passages,
however, both of the recitative and the songs, the beauty of the
movement or the force of the sentiment drew from her tones of
mingled grace and energy, which ‘might create a soul under the ribs
of death.’ This effect seemed to be purely involuntary, and not to
proceed from any desire to gratify the audience, or to do justice to
the part she had to sustain.</p>

<p class='c014'>The same objections cannot be applied to the acting of Signor
Tramezzani, in which there was no want of animation or effort. We
are not among this gentleman’s enthusiastic admirers; at the same
time we would not wish to speak of him more contemptuously than
he deserves. There is, we think, in general, considerable propriety
in his conception, and great spirit in his execution; but it is almost
universally carried into grimace and caricature. His heroes have the
fierceness of bullies; his lovers are the fondest creatures;—his frowns
and his smiles seem alike fated to kill. We object most to the latter.
Signor Tramezzani is really too prodigal of his physical accomplishments:
his acting is quite of the amatory kind. We see no reason
why Æneas, because Dido takes him by the hand, should ogle the
sweet heavens with such tender glances, nor why his lips should feed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>on the imagination of a kiss, as if he had tasted marmalade. Signor
Tramezzani’s amorous raptures put us in mind of the pious ardours of
a female saint, who sighs out her soul at some divine man at a conventicle.
We hate such fulsome fooleries.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the Opera ‘God save the King’ was sung. The first verse
was given by Madame Grassini, with that ease and simplicity which
are natural to her. The second was torn to tatters by Signor
Tramezzani with every preposterous accompaniment of imitative
action. Into the homely couplet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Scatter his enemies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make them fall,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>he introduced as much heroic action, as if Jove, in the first line, had
had to shake a thousand thunderbolts from his hand, and in the next
to transfix the giants to the earth. The bow with which this
celebrated actor quitted the stage was endless and inimitable. The
Genius of Scotland would have turned pale with envy at the sight!
Of the other performers we shall say nothing. M. Vestris made an
able-bodied representative of Zephyr in the ballet.</p>

<p class='c014'>We occasionally see something on the stage that reminds us a little
of Shakespear. Miss O’Neill’s Juliet, if it does not correspond
exactly with our idea of the character, does not degrade it. We
never saw Garrick; and Mrs. Siddons was the only person who ever
embodied our idea of high tragedy. Her mind and person were both
fitted for it. The effect of her acting was greater than could be
conceived before-hand. It perfectly filled and overpowered the mind.
The first time of seeing this great artist was an epoch in every one’s
life, and left impressions which could never be forgotten. She
appeared to belong to a superior order of beings, to be surrounded
with a personal awe, like some prophetess of old, or Roman matron,
the mother of Coriolanus or the Gracchi. Her voice answered to
her form, and her expression to both. Yet she was a pantomime
actress. Her common recitation was faulty. It was in bursts of
indignation, or grief, in sudden exclamations, in apostrophes and
inarticulate sounds, that she raised the soul of passion to its height, or
sunk it in despair.</p>

<p class='c014'>We remember her manner in the Gamester, when Stukeley, (it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>was then played by Palmer), declares his love to her. The look,
first of incredulity and astonishment, then of anger, then passing
suddenly into contempt, and ending in bitter scorn, and a convulsive
burst of laughter, all given in a moment, and laying open every
movement of the soul, produced an effect which we shall never
forget. Her manner of rubbing her hands, in the night scene in
Macbeth, and of dismissing the guests at the banquet, were among her
finest things. We have, many years ago, wept outright during the
whole time of her playing Isabella, and this we take to have been a
higher employment of the critical faculties than doubling down the
book in dog-ears to make out a regular list of critical common-places.
To the tears formerly shed on such occasions, we may apply the
words of a modern dashing orator, ‘Sweet is the dew of their
memory, and pleasant the balm of their recollection.’</p>

<p class='c014'>We have, we believe, been betrayed into this digression, because
Miss O’Neill, more than any late actress, reminded us in certain
passages, and in a faint degree, of Mrs. Siddons. This young lady,
who will probably become a favourite with the public, is rather tall;
and though not <i>of the first order of fine forms</i>, her figure is of that
respectable kind, which will not interfere with the characters she
represents. Her deportment is not particularly graceful: there is a
heaviness, and want of firmness about it. Her features are regular,
and the upper part of her face finely expressive of terror or sorrow.
It has that mixture of beauty and passion which we admire so much
in some of the antique statues. The lower part of her face is not
equally good. From a want of fulness or flexibility about the mouth,
her laugh is not at any time pleasing, and where it is a laugh of
terror, is distorted and painful. Her voice, without being musical, is
distinct, powerful, and capable of every necessary exertion. Her
action is impressive and simple. She looks the part she has to
perform, and fills up the pauses in the words, by the varied expression
of her countenance or gestures, without any thing artificial, pointed,
or far-fetched.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the silent expression of feeling, we have seldom witnessed any
thing finer than her acting, where she is told of Romeo’s death, her
listening to the Friar’s story of the poison, and her change of manner
towards the Nurse, when she advises her to marry Paris. Her
delivery of the speeches in the scenes where she laments Romeo’s
banishment, and anticipates her waking in the tomb, marked the fine
play and undulation of natural sensibility, rising and falling with the
gusts of passion, and at last worked up into an agony of despair, in
which imagination approaches the brink of frenzy. Her actually
screaming at the imaginary sight of Tybalt’s ghost, appeared to us the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>only instance of extravagance or caricature. Not only is there a
distinction to be kept up between physical and intellectual horror,
(for the latter becomes more general, internal, and absorbed, in
proportion as it becomes more intense), but the scream, in the present
instance, startled the audience, as it preceded the speech which
explained its meaning. Perhaps the emphasis given to the exclamation,
‘<i>And Romeo banished</i>,’ and to the description of Tybalt,
‘<i>festering in his shroud</i>,’ was too much in that epigrammatic, pointed
style, which we think inconsistent with the severe and simple dignity
of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the last scene, at the tomb with Romeo, which, however, is not
from Shakespear, though it tells admirably on the stage, she did not
produce the effect we expected. Miss O’Neill seemed least successful
in the former part of the character, in the garden scene, &amp;c. The
expression of tenderness bordered on hoydening, and affectation.
The character of Juliet is a pure effusion of nature. It is as serious,
and as much in earnest, as it is frank and susceptible. It has all the
exquisite voluptuousness of youthful innocence.—There is not the
slightest appearance of coquetry in it, no sentimental languor, no
meretricious assumption of fondness to take her lover by surprise.
She ought not to laugh, when she says, ‘I have forgot why I did call
thee back,’ as if conscious of the artifice, nor hang in a fondling
posture over the balcony. Shakespear has given a fine idea of the
composure of the character, where he first describes her at the
window, leaning her cheek upon her arm. The whole expression of
her love should be like the breath of flowers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Jones’s Mercutio was lively farce. Of Mr. Conway’s
Romeo, we cannot speak with patience. He bestrides the stage like
a Colossus, throws his arms into the air like the sails of a windmill,
and his motion is as unwieldy as that of a young elephant. His
voice breaks in thunder on the ear like Gargantua’s, but when he
pleases to be soft, he is ‘the very beadle to an amorous sigh.’ Mr.
Coates’s absurdities are tame and trifling in comparison.—<i>Quere</i>,
Why does he not marry?</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Oct. 9, 1814.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We do not think Mr. Kean at all improved by his Irish expedition.
As this is a point in which we feel a good deal of interest,
both on Mr. Kean’s account and our own, we shall state briefly our
objections to some alterations in his mode of acting, which appear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>us for the worse. His pauses are twice as long as they were, and the
rapidity with which he hurries over other parts of the dialogue is
twice as great as it was. In both these points, his style of acting
always bordered on the very verge of extravagance; and we suspect
it has at present passed the line. There are, no doubt, passages in
which the pauses can hardly be too long, or too marked;—these
must be, however, of rare occurrence, and it is in the finding out
these exceptions to the general rule, and in daring to give them all
their effect, that the genius of an actor discovers itself. But the most
common-place drawling monotony is not more mechanical or more
offensive, than the converting these exceptions into a general rule, and
making every sentence an alternation of dead pauses and rapid
transitions.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c015'><sup>[31]</sup></a> It is not in extremes that dramatic genius is shewn, any
more than skill in music consists in passing continually from the
highest to the lowest note. The quickness of familiar utterance with
which Mr. Kean pronounced the anticipated doom of Stanley, ‘chop
off his head,’ was quite ludicrous. Again, the manner in which,
after his nephew said, ‘I fear no uncles dead,’ he suddenly turned
round, and answered, ‘And I hope none living, sir,’ was, we thought,
quite out of character. The motion was performed, and the sounds
uttered, in the smallest possible time in which a puppet could be made
to mimic or gabble the part. For this we see not the least reason;
and can only account for it, from a desire to give excessive effect by
a display of the utmost dexterity of execution.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is almost needless to observe, that executive power in acting, as
in all other arts, is only valuable as it is made subservient to truth and
nature. Even some want of mechanical skill is better than the
perpetual affectation of shewing it. The absence of a quality is often
less provoking than its abuse, because less voluntary.</p>

<p class='c014'>The part which was least varied was the scene with Lady Anne.
This is, indeed, nearly a perfect piece of acting. In leaning against
the pillar at the commencement of the scene, Mr. Kean did not go
through exactly the same regular evolution of graceful attitudes, and
we regretted the omission. He frequently varied the execution of
many of his most striking conceptions, and the attempt in general
failed, as it naturally must do. We refer particularly to his manner
of resting on the point of his sword before he retires to his tent, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>his treatment of the letter sent to Norfolk, and to his dying scene with
Richmond.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean’s <i>bye-play</i> is certainly one of his greatest excellences,
and it might be said, that if Shakespear had written marginal
directions to the players, in the manner of the German dramatists, he
would often have directed them to do what Mr. Kean does. Such
additions to the text are, however, to be considered as lucky hits, and
it is not to be supposed that an actor is to provide an endless variety
of these running accompaniments, which he is not in strictness bound
to provide at all. In general, we think it a rule, that an actor ought
to vary his part as little as possible, unless he is convinced that his
former mode of playing it is erroneous. He should make up his
mind as to the best mode of representing the part, and come as near
to this standard as he can, in every successive exhibition. It is
absurd to object to this mechanical uniformity as studied and artificial.
All acting is studied or artificial. An actor is no more called upon
to vary his gestures or articulation at every new rehearsal of the
character, than an author can be required to furnish various readings
to every separate copy of his work. To a new audience it is quite
unnecessary; to those who have seen him before in the same part, it
is worse than useless. They may at least be presumed to have come
to a second representation, because they approved of the first, and
will be sure to be disappointed in almost every alteration. The
attempt is endless, and can only produce perplexity and indecision in
the actor himself. He must either return perpetually in the same
narrow round, or if he is determined to be always new, he may at
last fancy that he ought to perform the part standing on his head
instead of his feet. Besides, Mr. Kean’s style of acting is not in the
least of the unpremeditated, <i>improvisatori</i> kind: it is throughout
elaborate and systematic, instead of being loose, off-hand, and
accidental. He comes upon the stage as little unprepared as any
actor we know. We object particularly to his varying the original
action in the dying scene. He at first held out his hands in a way
which can only be conceived by those who saw him—in motionless
despair,—or as if there were some preternatural power in the
mere manifestation of his will:—he now actually fights with his
doubled fists, after his sword is taken from him, like some helpless
infant.</p>

<p class='c014'>We have been quite satisfied with the attempts we have seen to ape
Mr. Kean in this part, without wishing to see him ape himself in it.
There is no such thing as trick in matters of genius. All poetical
licenses, however beautiful in themselves, by being parodied, instantly
become ridiculous. It is because beauties of this kind have no clue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>to them, and are reducible to no standard, that it is the peculiar
province of genius to detect them; by making them common, and
reducing them to a rule, you make them perfectly mechanical, and
perfectly absurd into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c014'>To conclude our hypercritical remarks: we really think that
Mr. Kean was, in a great many instances, either too familiar, too
emphatical, or too energetic. In the latter scenes, perhaps his energy
could not be too great; but he gave the energy of action alone. He
merely gesticulated, or at best vociferated the part. His articulation
totally failed him. We doubt, if a single person in the house, not
acquainted with the play, understood a single sentence that he uttered.
It was ‘inexplicable dumb show and noise.’—We wish to throw the
fault of most of our objections on the managers. Their conduct has
been marked by one uniform character, a paltry attention to their own
immediate interest, a distrust of Mr. Kean’s abilities to perform more
than the character he had succeeded in, and a contempt for the wishes
of the public. They have spun him tediously out in every character,
and have forced him to display the variety of his talents in the same,
instead of different characters. They kept him back in Shylock, till
he nearly failed in Richard from a cold. Why not bring him out in
Macbeth, which was at one time got up for him? Why not bring
him out at once in a variety of characters, as the Dublin managers
have done? It does not appear that either they or he suffered by it.
It seems, by all we can find, that versatility is, perhaps, Mr. Kean’s
greatest excellence. Why, then, not give him his range? Why
tantalize the public? Why extort from them their last shilling for
the twentieth repetition of the same part, instead of letting them make
their election for themselves, of what they like best? It is really
very pitiful.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ill as we conceive the London managers have treated him, the
London audiences have treated him well, and we wish Mr. Kean, for
some years at least, to stick to them. They are his best friends;
and he may assuredly account us, who have made these sorry remarks
upon him, not among his worst. After he has got through the season
here well, we see no reason why he should make himself hoarse with
performing Hamlet at twelve o’clock, and Richard at six, at Kidderminster.
At his time of life, and with his prospects, the improvement
of his fortune is not the principal thing. A training under Captain
Barclay would do more towards strengthening his mind and body,
his fame and fortune, than sharing bumper receipts with the Dublin
managers, or carousing with the whole Irish bar. Or, if Mr. Kean
does not approve of this rough regimen, he might devote the summer
vacation to the Muses. To a man of genius, leisure is the first of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>benefits, as well as of luxuries; where, ‘with her best nurse,
Contemplation,’ the mind</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It was our first duty to point out Mr. Kean’s excellences to the
public, and we did so with no sparing hand; it is our second duty to
him, to ourselves, and the public, to distinguish between his
excellences and defects, and to prevent, if possible, his excellences
from degenerating into defects.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Nov. 13, 1814.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The genius of Shakespear was as much shewn in the subtlety and
nice discrimination, as in the force and variety of his characters.
The distinction is not preserved more completely in those which are
the most opposite, than in those which in their general features and
obvious appearance most nearly resemble each other. It has been
observed, with very little exaggeration, that not one of his speeches
could be put into the mouth of any other character than the one to
which it is given, and that the transposition, if attempted, might be
always detected from some circumstance in the passage itself. If <i>to
invent according to nature</i>, be the true definition of genius, Shakespear
had more of this quality than any other writer. He might be said to
have been a joint-worker with Nature, and to have created an
imaginary world of his own, which has all the appearance and the
truth of reality. His mind, while it exerted an absolute controul
over the stronger workings of the passions, was exquisitely alive to
the slightest impulses and most evanescent shades of character and
feeling. The broad distinctions and governing principles of human
nature are presented not in the abstract, but in their immediate and
endless application to different persons and things. The local details,
the particular accidents have the fidelity of history, without losing any
thing of their general effect.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is the business of poetry, and indeed of all works of imagination,
to exhibit the species through the individual. Otherwise, there can
be no opportunity for the exercise of the imagination, without which
the descriptions of the painter or the poet are lifeless, unsubstantial,
and vapid. If some modern critics are right, with their sweeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>generalities and vague abstractions, Shakespear was quite wrong. In
the French dramatists, only the class is represented, never the
individual: their kings, their heroes, and their lovers are all the
same, and they are all French—that is, they are nothing but the
mouth-pieces of certain rhetorical common-place sentiments on the
favourite topics of morality and the passions. The characters in
Shakespear do not declaim like pedantic school-boys, but speak and
act like men, placed in real circumstances, with ‘real hearts of flesh
and blood beating in their bosoms.’ No two of his characters are the
same, more than they would be so in nature. Those that are the
most alike, are distinguished by positive differences, which accompany
and modify the leading principle of the character through its most
obscure ramifications, embodying the habits, gestures, and almost
the looks of the individual. These touches of nature are often so
many, and so minute, that the poet cannot be supposed to have
been distinctly aware of the operation of the springs by which
his imagination was set at work: yet every one of the results is
brought out with a truth and clearness, as if his whole study had
been directed to that peculiar trait of character, or subordinate train
of feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus Macbeth, and Richard the Third, King Henry the Sixth,
and Richard the Second,—characters that, in their general description,
and in common hands, would be merely repetitions of the same
idea—are distinguished by traits as precise, though of course less
violent, than those which separate Macbeth from Henry the Sixth,
or Richard the Third from Richard the Second. Shakespear has,
with wonderful accuracy, and without the smallest appearance of
effort, varied the portraits of imbecility and effeminacy in the two
deposed monarchs. With still more powerful and masterly strokes,
he has marked the different effects of ambition and cruelty, operating
on different dispositions in different circumstances, in his Macbeth
and Richard the Third. Both are tyrants and usurpers, both violent
and ambitious, both cruel and treacherous. But, Richard is cruel
from nature and constitution. Macbeth becomes so from accidental
circumstances. He is urged to the commission of guilt by golden
opportunity, by the instigations of his wife, and by prophetic
warnings. ‘Fate and metaphysical aid,’ conspire against his virtue
and loyalty. Richard needs no prompter, but wades through a series
of crimes to the height of his ambition, from ungovernable passions
and the restless love of mischief. He is never gay but in the prospect,
or in the success of his villanies: Macbeth is full of horror at the
thoughts of the murder of Duncan, and of remorse after its perpetration.
Richard has no mixture of humanity in his composition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>no tie which binds him to the kind; he owns no fellowship with
others, but is himself alone. Macbeth is not without feelings of
sympathy, is accessible to pity, is even the dupe of his uxoriousness,
and ranks the loss of friends and of his good name among the causes
that have made him sick of life. He becomes more callous indeed as
he plunges deeper in guilt, ‘direness is thus made familiar to his
slaughterous thoughts,’ and he anticipates his wife in the boldness and
bloodiness of his enterprises, who, for want of the same stimulus of
action, is ‘troubled with thick-coming fancies,’ walks in her sleep,
goes mad, and dies. Macbeth endeavours to escape from reflection
on his crimes, by repelling their consequences, and banishes remorse
for the past, by meditating future mischief. This is not the principle
of Richard’s cruelty, which resembles the cold malignity of a fiend,
rather than the frailty of human nature. Macbeth is goaded on by
necessity; to Richard, blood is a pastime.—</p>

<p class='c014'>There are other essential differences. Richard is a man of the
world, a vulgar, plotting, hardened villain, wholly regardless of every
thing but his own ends, and the means to accomplish them. Not so
Macbeth. The superstitions of the time, the rude state of society,
the local scenery and customs, all give a wildness and imaginary
grandeur to his character. From the strangeness of the events which
surround him, he is full of amazement and fear, and stands in doubt
between the world of reality and the world of fancy. He sees sights
not shewn to mortal eye, and hears unearthly music. All is tumult
and disorder within and without his mind. In thought, he is absent
and perplexed, desperate in act: his purposes recoil upon himself, are
broken, and disjointed: he is the double thrall of his passions and his
evil destiny. He treads upon the brink of fate, and grows dizzy
with his situation. Richard is not a character of imagination, but of
pure will or passion. There is no conflict of opposite feelings in his
breast. The apparitions which he sees are in his sleep, nor does he
live like Macbeth, in a waking dream.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such, at least, is our conception of the two characters, as drawn by
Shakespear. Mr. Kean does not distinguish them so completely as
he might. His Richard comes nearer to the original than his
Macbeth. He was deficient in the poetry of the character. He did
not look like a man who had encountered the Weird Sisters. There
should be nothing tight or compact in Macbeth, no tenseness of fibre,
nor pointed decision of manner. He has, indeed, energy and
manliness of soul, but ‘subject to all the skyey influences.’ He is
sure of nothing. All is left at issue. He runs a-tilt with fortune,
and is baffled with preternatural riddles. The agitation of his mind
resembles the rolling of the sea in a storm; or, he is like a lion in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the toils—fierce, impetuous, and ungovernable. In the fifth act in
particular, which is in itself as busy and turbulent as possible, there
was not that giddy whirl of the imagination—the character did not
burnish out on all sides with those flashes of genius, of which Mr.
Kean had given so fine an earnest in the conclusion of his Richard.
The scene stood still—the parts might be perfect in themselves, but
they were not joined together; they wanted vitality. The pauses in
the speeches were too long—the actor seemed to be studying the
part, rather than performing it—striving to make every word more
emphatic than the last, and ‘lost too poorly in himself,’ instead of
being carried away with the grandeur of his subject. The text was
not given accurately. Macbeth is represented in the play, arming
before the castle, which adds to the interest of the scene.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the delivery of the beautiful soliloquy, ‘My way of life is
fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf,’ Mr. Kean was unsuccessful.
That fine thoughtful melancholy did not seem to come over his mind,
which characterises Mr. Kemble’s recitation of these lines. The
very tone of Mr. Kemble’s voice has something retrospective in
it—it is an echo of the past. Mr. Kean in his dress was occasionally
too much docked and curtailed for the gravity of the character.
His movements were too agile and mercurial, and he fought more
like a modern fencing-master than a Scottish chieftain of the eleventh
century. He fell at last finely, with his face downwards, as if to
cover the shame of his defeat. We recollect that Mr. Cooke
discovered the great actor both in the death-scene in Macbeth, and
in that of Richard. He fell like the ruin of a state, like a king with
his regalia about him.</p>

<p class='c014'>The two finest things that Mr. Kean has ever done, are his
recitation of the passage in Othello, ‘Then, oh, farewell the tranquil
mind,’ and the scene in Macbeth after the murder. The former was
the highest and most perfect effort of his art. To enquire whether
his manner in the latter scene was that of a king who commits a
murder, or of a man who commits a murder to become a king,
would be ‘to consider too curiously.’ But, as a lesson of common
humanity, it was heart-rending. The hesitation, the bewildered
look, the coming to himself when he sees his hands bloody; the
manner in which his voice clung to his throat, and choaked his
utterance; his agony and tears, the force of nature overcome by
passion—beggared description. It was a scene, which no one who
saw it can ever efface from his recollection.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean appeared at Drury-Lane in the character of Romeo,
for the first time on Monday last. The house was crowded at an
early hour, and neither those who went to admire, nor those who
went to find fault, could go away disappointed. He discovered no
new and unlooked-for excellences in the part, but displayed the same
extraordinary energies which he never fails to do on every occasion.
There is, indeed, a set of ingenious persons, who having perceived
on Mr. Kean’s first appearance, that he was a little man with an
inharmonious voice, and no very great dignity or elegance of manner,
go regularly to the theatre to confirm themselves in this singular piece
of sagacity; and finding that the object of their contempt and wonder
has not, since they last saw him, ‘added a cubit to his stature,’—that
his tones have not become ‘as musical as is Apollo’s lute,’ and that
there is still an habitual want of grace about him, are determined,
till such a metamorphosis is effected, not to allow a particle of genius
to the actor, or of taste or common sense to those who are not stupidly
blind to every thing but his defects. That an actor with very
moderate abilities, having the advantages of voice, person and gracefulness
of manner on his side, should acquire a very high reputation, is
what we can understand, and have seen some instances of; but that
an actor with almost every physical disadvantage against him, should,
without very extraordinary powers and capacities indeed, be able to
excite the most enthusiastic and general admiration, would, we
conceive, be a phenomenon in the history of public imposture,
totally without example. In fact, the generality of critics who
undertake to give the tone to public opinion, have neither the
courage nor discernment to decide on the merits of a truly excellent
and original actor, and are equally without the candour to acknowledge
their error, after they find themselves in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c014'>In going to see Mr. Kean in any new character, we do not go in
the expectation of seeing either a perfect actor or perfect acting;
because this is what we have not yet seen, either in him or in any
one else. But we go to see (what he never disappoints us in) great
spirit, ingenuity, and originality given to the text in general, and an
energy and depth of passion given to certain scenes and passages,
which we should in vain look for from any other actor on the stage.
In every character that he has played, in Shylock, in Richard, in
Hamlet, in Othello, in Iago, in Luke, and in Macbeth, there has
been either a dazzling repetition of master-strokes of art and nature,
or if at any time (from a want of physical adaptation, or sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>of just conception of the character) the interest has flagged for a
considerable interval, the deficiency has always been redeemed by
some collected and overpowering display of energy or pathos, which
electrified at the moment, and left a lasting impression on the mind
afterwards. Such, for instance, were the murder-scene in Macbeth, the
third act of his Othello, the interview with Ophelia in Hamlet, and,
lastly, the scene with Friar Lawrence, and the death-scene in Romeo.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the characters that Mr. Kean has played, Hamlet and Romeo
are the most like one another, at least in adventitious circumstances;
those to which Mr. Kean’s powers are least adapted, and in which
he has failed most in general truth of conception and continued
interest. There is in both characters the same strong tincture of
youthful enthusiasm, of tender melancholy, of romantic thought
and sentiment; but we confess we did not see these qualities in
Mr. Kean’s performance of either. His Romeo had nothing of the
lover in it. We never saw any thing less ardent or less voluptuous.
In the Balcony-scene in particular, he was cold, tame, and unimpressive.
It was said of Garrick and Barry in this scene, that the
one acted it as if he would jump up to the lady, and the other
as if he would make the lady jump down to him. Mr. Kean
produced neither of these effects. He stood like a statue of lead.
Even Mr. Conway might feel taller on the occasion, and Mr. Coates
wonder at the taste of the public. The only time in this scene when
he attempted to give any thing like an effect, was when he smiled
on over-hearing Juliet’s confession of her passion. But the smile
was less like that of a fortunate lover who unexpectedly hears his
happiness confirmed, than of a discarded lover, who hears of the
disappointment of a rival.—The whole of this part not only wanted
‘the silver sound of lovers’ tongues by night’ to recommend it,
but warmth, tenderness,—everything which it should have possessed.
Mr. Kean was like a man waiting to receive a message from his
mistress through her confidante, not like one who was pouring out
his rapturous vows to the idol of his soul. There was neither
glowing animation, nor melting softness in his manner; his cheek
was not flushed, no sigh breathed involuntary from his overcharged
bosom: all was forced and lifeless. His acting sometimes reminded
us of the scene with Lady Anne, and we cannot say a worse thing
of it, considering the difference of the two characters. Mr. Kean’s
imagination appears not to have the principles of joy, or hope, or love
in it. He seems chiefly sensible to pain, or to the passions that
spring from it, and to the terrible energies of mind or body, which
are necessary to grapple with, or to avert it. Even over the world
of passion he holds but a divided sway: he either does not feel, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>seldom expresses, deep, sustained, internal sentiment,—there is no
repose in his mind: no feeling seems to take full possession of it,
that is not linked to action, and that does not goad him on to the
phrenzy of despair. Or if he ever conveys the sublimer pathos of
thought and feeling, it is after the storm of passion, to which he has
been worked up, has subsided. The tide of feeling then at times
rolls deep, majestic, and awful, like the surging sea after a tempest,
now lifted to Heaven, now laying bare the bosom of the deep.
Thus after the violence and anguish of the scene with Iago, in the
third act of Othello, his voice in the farewell apostrophe to Content,
took the deep intonation of the pealing organ, and heaved from the
heart sounds that came on the ear like the funeral dirge of years
of promised happiness. So in the midst of the extravagant and
irresistible expression of Romeo’s grief, at being banished from the
object of his love, his voice suddenly stops, and faulters, and is
choaked with sobs of tenderness, when he comes to Juliet’s name.
Those persons must be made of sterner stuff than ourselves, who are
proof against Mr. Kean’s acting, both in this scene, and in his dying
convulsion at the close of the play. But in the fine soliloquy
beginning, ‘What said my man, when my betossed soul, &amp;c.’—and
at the tomb afterwards—‘Here will I set up my everlasting
rest, and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied
flesh,’—in these, where the sentiment is subdued and
profound, and the passion is lost in calm, fixed despair, Mr. Kean’s
acting was comparatively ineffectual. There was nothing in his
manner of delivering this last exquisitely beautiful speech, which
echoed to the still sad music of humanity, which recalled past hopes,
or reposed on the dim shadowings of futurity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean affects the audience from the force of passion instead of
sentiment, or sinks into pathos from the violence of action, but seldom
rises into it from the power of thought and feeling. In this respect,
he presents almost a direct contrast to Miss O’Neill. Her energy
always arises out of her sensibility. Distress takes possession of,
and overcomes her faculties; she triumphs in her weakness, and
vanquishes by yielding. Mr. Kean is greatest in the conflict of
passion, and resistance to his fate, in the opposition of his will, in
the keen excitement of his understanding. His Romeo is, in the
best scenes, very superior to Miss O’Neill’s Juliet; but it is with
some difficulty, and after some reflection, that we should say that
the finest parts of his acting are superior to the finest parts of hers;—to
her parting with Jaffier in Belvidera,—to her terror and her joy
in meeting with Biron, in Isabella,—to the death-scene in the same
character, and to the scene in the prison with her husband as Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Beverley. Her acting is undoubtedly more correct, equable, and
faultless throughout than Mr. Kean’s, and it is quite as affecting at
the time, in the most impassioned parts. But it does not leave the
same impression on the mind afterwards. It adds little to the stock
of our ideas, or to our materials for reflection, but passes away with
the momentary illusion of the scene. And this difference of effect,
perhaps, arises from the difference of the parts they have to sustain
on the stage. In the female characters which Miss O’Neill plays,
the distress is in a great measure physical and natural: that is,—such
as is common to every sensible woman in similar circumstances. She
abandons herself to every impulse of grief or tenderness, and revels in
the excess of an uncontroulable affliction. She can call to her aid,
with perfect propriety and effect, all the weaknesses of her sex,—tears,
sighs, convulsive sobs, shrieks, death-like stupefaction, and
laughter more terrible than all. But it is not the same in the parts
in which Mr. Kean has to act. There must here be a manly
fortitude, as well as a natural sensibility. There must be a restraint
constantly put upon the feelings by the understanding and the will.
He must be ‘as one, in suffering all, who suffers nothing.’ He
cannot give way entirely to his situation or his feelings, but must
endeavour to become master of them, and of himself. This, in
our conception, must make it more easy to give entire effect and
interest to female characters on the stage, by rendering the expression
of passion more obvious, simple, and natural; and must also make
them less rememberable afterwards, by leaving less scope for the
exercise of intellect, and for the distinct and complicated reaction
of the character upon circumstances. At least, we can only account
in some such way for the different impressions which the acting of
these two admired performers makes on our mind, when we see, or
when we think of them. As critics, we particularly feel this. Mr.
Kean affords a never-failing source of observation and discussion; we
can only <i>praise</i> Miss O’Neill.—The peculiarity and the strong hold
of Mrs. Siddons’ acting was, that she, in a wonderful manner,
united both the extremes of acting here spoken of,—that is, all
the frailties of passion, with all the strength and resources of the
intellect.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>MR. KEAN’S IAGO.</h3>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>July 24, 1814.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We regretted some time ago, that we could only get a casual
glimpse of Mr. Kean in the character of Iago; we have since been
more fortunate, and we certainly think his performance of the part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>one of the most extraordinary exhibitions on the stage. There is no
one within our remembrance, who has so completely foiled the critics
as this celebrated actor: one sagacious person imagines that he must
perform a part in a certain manner; another virtuoso chalks out a
different path for him; and when the time comes, he does the whole
off in a way, that neither of them had the least conception of, and
which both of them are therefore very ready to condemn as entirely
wrong. It was ever the trick of genius to be thus. We confess
that Mr. Kean has thrown us out more than once. For instance,
we are very much inclined to persist in the objection we before made,
that his Richard is not gay enough, and that his Iago is not grave
enough. This he may perhaps conceive to be the mere caprice of
captious criticism; but we will try to give our reasons, and shall
leave them to Mr. Kean’s better judgment.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is to be remembered, then, that Richard was a princely villain,
borne along in a sort of triumphal car of royal state, buoyed up with
the hopes and privileges of his birth, reposing even on the sanctity of
religion, trampling on his devoted victims without remorse, and who
looked out and laughed from the high watch-tower of his confidence
and his expectations, on the desolation and misery he had caused
around him. He held on his way, unquestioned, ‘hedged in with
the divinity of kings,’ amenable to no tribunal, and abusing his power
<i>in contempt of mankind</i>. But as for Iago, we conceive differently of
him. He had not the same natural advantages. He was a mere
adventurer in mischief, a pains-taking, plodding knave, without patent
or pedigree, who was obliged to work his uphill way by wit, not by
will, and to be the founder of his own fortune. He was, if we may
be allowed a vulgar allusion, a true prototype of modern Jacobinism,
who thought that talents ought to decide the place; a man of ‘morbid
sensibility’ (in the fashionable phrase), full of distrust, of hatred,
of anxious and corroding thoughts, and who, though he might assume
a temporary superiority over others by superior adroitness, and pride
himself in his skill, could not be supposed to assume it as a matter of
course, as if he had been entitled to it from his birth.</p>

<p class='c014'>We do not here mean to enter into the characters of the two men,
but something must be allowed to the difference of their situations.
There might be the same indifference in both as to the end in view,
but there could not well be the same security as to the success of the
means. Iago had to pass through a different ordeal: he had no
appliances and means to boot; no royal road to the completion of his
tragedy. His pretensions were not backed by authority; they were
not baptized at the font; they were not holy-water proof. He had
the whole to answer for in his own person, and could not shift the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>responsibility to the heads of others. Mr. Kean’s Richard was
therefore, we think, deficient in something of that regal jollity and
reeling triumph of success which the part would bear; but this we
can easily account for, because it is the traditional common-place idea
of the character, that he is to ‘play the dog—to bite and snarl.’—The
extreme unconcern and laboured levity of his Iago, on the
contrary, is a refinement and original device of the actor’s own mind,
and deserves a distinct consideration. The character of Iago, in fact,
belongs to a class of characters common to Shakespear, and at the
same time peculiar to him, namely, that of great intellectual activity,
accompanied with a total want of moral principle, and therefore
displaying itself at the constant expence of others, making use of
reason as a pander to will—employing its ingenuity and its resources
to palliate its own crimes, and aggravate the faults of others, and
seeking to confound the practical distinctions of right and wrong,
by referring them to some overstrained standard of speculative
refinement.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some persons more nice than wise, have thought the whole of the
character of Iago unnatural. Shakespear, who was quite as good a
philosopher as he was a poet, thought otherwise. He knew that the
love of power, which is another name for the love of mischief, was
natural to man. He would know this as well or better than if it had
been demonstrated to him by a logical diagram, merely from seeing
children paddle in the dirt, or kill flies for sport. We might ask
those who think the character of Iago not natural, why they go to
see it performed—but from the interest it excites, the sharper edge
which it sets on their curiosity and imagination? Why do we go to
see tragedies in general! Why do we always read the accounts in
the newspapers, of dreadful fires and shocking murders, but for the
same reason? Why do so many persons frequent executions and
trials; or why do the lower classes almost universally take delight
in barbarous sports and cruelty to animals, but because there is a
natural tendency in the mind to strong excitement, a desire to have
its faculties roused and stimulated to the utmost? Whenever this
principle is not under the restraint of humanity or the sense of moral
obligation, there are no excesses to which it will not of itself give
rise, without the assistance of any other motive, either of passion or
self-interest. Iago is only an extreme instance of the kind; that is,
of diseased intellectual activity, with an almost perfect indifference
to moral good or evil, or rather with a preference of the latter,
because it falls more in with his favourite propensity, gives greater
zest to his thoughts and scope to his actions. Be it observed, too,
(for the sake of those who are for squaring all human actions by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>maxims of Rochefoucault), that he is quite or nearly as indifferent to
his own fate as to that of others; that he runs all risks for a trifling
and doubtful advantage; and is himself the dupe and victim of his
ruling passion—an incorrigible love of mischief—an insatiable craving
after action of the most difficult and dangerous kind. Our Ancient
is a philosopher, who fancies that a lie that kills, has more point
in it than an alliteration or an antithesis; who thinks a fatal experiment
on the peace of a family a better thing than watching the
palpitations in the heart of a flea in an air-pump; who plots the ruin
of his friends as an exercise for his understanding, and stabs men in
the dark to prevent <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. Now this, though it be sport, yet it is
dreadful sport. There is no room for trifling and indifference, nor
scarcely for the appearance of it; the very object of his whole plot
is to keep his faculties stretched on the rack, in a state of watch and
ward, in a sort of breathless suspense, without a moment’s interval of
repose. He has a desperate stake to play for, like a man who fences
with poisoned weapons, and has business enough on his hands to call
for the whole stock of his sober circumspection, his dark duplicity,
and insidious gravity. He resembles a man who sits down to play at
chess, for the sake of the difficulty and complication of the game,
and who immediately becomes absorbed in it. His amusements, if
they are amusements, are severe and saturnine—even his wit blisters.
His gaiety arises from the success of his treachery; his ease from the
sense of the torture he has inflicted on others. Even if other circumstances
permitted it, the part he has to play with Othello requires
that he should assume the most serious concern, and something of
the plausibility of a confessor. ‘His cue is villainous melancholy, with
a sigh like Tom o’ Bedlam.’ He is repeatedly called ‘honest Iago,’
which looks as if there were something suspicious in his appearance,
which admitted a different construction. The tone which he adopts
in the scenes with Roderigo, Desdemona, and Cassio, is only a
relaxation from the more arduous business of the play. Yet there is
in all his conversation, an inveterate misanthropy, a licentious keenness
of perception, which is always sagacious of evil, and snuffs up
the tainted scent of its quarry with rancorous delight. An exuberance
of spleen is the essence of the character. The view which we have
here taken of the subject, (if at all correct) will not therefore justify
the extreme alteration which Mr. Kean has introduced into the
part.</p>

<p class='c014'>Actors in general have been struck only with the wickedness of
the character, and have exhibited an assassin going to the place
of execution. Mr. Kean has abstracted the wit of the character, and
makes Iago appear throughout an excellent good fellow, and lively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>bottle-companion. But though we do not wish him to be represented
as a monster, or a fiend, we see no reason why he should instantly be
converted into a pattern of comic gaiety and good humour. The
light which illumines the character, should rather resemble the flashes
of lightning in the mirky sky, which make the darkness more terrible.
Mr. Kean’s Iago is, we suspect, too much in the sun. His manner
of acting the part would have suited better with the character of
Edmund in King Lear, who, though in other respects much the
same, has a spice of gallantry in his constitution, and has the favour
and countenance of the ladies, which always gives a man the smug
appearance of a bridegroom!—We shall in another article, illustrate
these remarks by a reference to some passages in the text itself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>Aug. 7, 1814.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The general groundwork of the character of Iago, as it appears to
us, is not absolute malignity, but a want of moral principle, or an
indifference to the real consequences of the actions, which the
meddling perversity of his disposition and love of immediate excitement
lead him to commit. He is an amateur of tragedy in real life;
and instead of exercising his ingenuity on imaginary characters, or
forgotten incidents, he takes the bolder and more desperate course of
getting up his plot at home, casts the principal parts among his nearest
friends and connections, and rehearses it in downright earnest, with
steady nerves and unabated resolution. The character is a complete
abstraction of the intellectual from the moral being; or, in other
words, consists in an absorption of every common feeling in the
virulence of his understanding, the deliberate wilfulness of his
purposes, and in his restless, untamable love of mischievous contrivance.
We proceed to quote some particular passages in support
of this opinion.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the general dialogue and reflections, which are an accompaniment
to the progress of the catastrophe, there is a constant overflowing
of gall and bitterness. The acuteness of his malice fastens upon
every thing alike, and pursues the most distant analogies of evil with
a provoking sagacity. He by no means forms an exception to his
own rule:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>‘Who has that breast so pure,</div>
      <div class='line'>But some uncleanly apprehensions</div>
      <div class='line'>Keep leets and law-days, and in sessions sit</div>
      <div class='line'>With meditations lawful?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>His mirth is not natural and cheerful, but forced and extravagant,
partaking of the intense activity of mind and cynical contempt of
others in which it originates. Iago is not, like Candide, a believer
in optimism, but seems to have a thorough hatred or distrust of every
thing of the kind, and to dwell with gloating satisfaction on whatever
can interrupt the enjoyment of others, and gratify his moody irritability.
One of his most characteristic speeches is that immediately
after the marriage of Othello:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Roderigo.</i> What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,</div>
      <div class='line'>If he can carry her thus?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Call up her father:</div>
      <div class='line'>Rouse him [<i>Othello</i>], make after him, poison his delight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Proclaim him in the streets, incense her kinsmen,</div>
      <div class='line'>And tho’ he in a fertile climate dwell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Plague him with flies: tho’ that his joy be joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,</div>
      <div class='line'>As it may lose some colour.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The pertinacious logical following up of his favourite principle in
this passage, is admirable. In the next, his imagination runs riot in
the mischief he is plotting, and breaks out into the wildness and
impetuosity of real enthusiasm:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Roderigo.</i> Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell,</div>
      <div class='line'>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</div>
      <div class='line'>Is spied in populous cities.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There is nothing here of the trim levity and epigrammatic conciseness
of Mr. Kean’s manner of acting the part; which is no less
paradoxical than Mrs. Greville’s celebrated Ode to Indifference.
Iago was a man of genius, and not a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit maitre</span></i>. One of his most
frequent topics, on which he is rich indeed, and in descanting on
which, his spleen serves him for a muse, is the disproportionate match
between Desdemona and the Moor. This is brought forward in the
first scene, and is never lost sight of afterwards.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Brabantio.</i> What is the reason of this terrible summons?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Sir, you’re robb’d; for shame, put on your gown;</div>
      <div class='line'>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul:</div>
      <div class='line'>——Arise, arise,</div>
      <div class='line'>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you.</div>
      <div class='line'>Arise, I say.’—[<i>And so on to the end of the passage.</i>]</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Now, all this goes on springs well oiled: Mr. Kean’s mode of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>giving the passage had the tightness of a drumhead, and was muffled
(perhaps purposely so) into the bargain.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is a clue to the character of the lady which Iago is not
at all ready to part with. He recurs to it again in the second
act, when in answer to his insinuations against Desdemona, Roderigo
says,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I cannot believe that in her—she’s full of most bless’d conditions.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Bless’d fig’s end. The wine she drinks is made of grapes. If</div>
      <div class='line'>she had been bless’d, she would never have loved the Moor.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And again, with still more effect and spirit afterwards, when
he takes advantage of this very suggestion arising in Othello’s own
breast:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Othello.</i> And yet how nature erring from itself—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Aye, there’s the point;—as, to be bold with you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Not to affect many proposed matches,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends;</div>
      <div class='line'>Foh! one may smell in such, a will most rank,</div>
      <div class='line'>Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This is probing to the quick. ‘Our Ancient’ here turns the
character of poor Desdemona, as it were, inside out. It is certain
that nothing but the genius of Shakespear could have preserved the
entire interest and delicacy of the part, and have even drawn an
additional elegance and dignity from the peculiar circumstances in
which she is placed. The character indeed has always had the
greatest charm for minds of the finest sensibility.</p>

<p class='c014'>For our own part, we are a little of Iago’s council in this matter;
and all circumstances considered, and platonics out of the question,
if we were to cast the complexion of Desdemona physiognomically,
we should say that she had a very fair skin, and very light auburn
hair, inclining to yellow! We at the same time give her infinite
credit for purity and delicacy of sentiment; but it so happens that
purity and grossness sometimes</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in22'>‘nearly are allied,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thin partitions do their bounds divide.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Yet the reverse does not hold; so uncertain and undefinable a thing
is moral character! It is no wonder that Iago had some contempt
for it, ‘who knew all quantities of human dealings, with a learned
spirit.’ There is considerable gaiety and ease in his dialogue with
Emilia and Desdemona on their landing. It is then holiday time
with him; but yet the general satire will be acknowledged (at least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>by one half of our readers) to be biting enough, and his idea of his
own character is finely expressed in what he says to Desdemona, when
she asks him how he would praise her—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh gentle lady, do not put me to it,</div>
      <div class='line'>For I am nothing, if not critical.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Kean’s execution of this part we thought admirable; but he was
quite as much at his ease in every other part of the play, which was
done (we know not why) in a single key.</p>

<p class='c014'>The habitual licentiousness of Iago’s conversation is not to be
traced to the pleasure he takes in gross or lascivious images, but to a
desire of finding out the worst side of every thing, and of proving
himself an over-match for appearances. He has none of ‘the milk of
human kindness’ in his composition. His imagination refuses every
thing that has not a strong infusion of the most unpalatable ingredients,
and his moral constitution digests only poisons. Virtue, or goodness,
or whatever has the least ‘relish of salvation in it,’ is, to his depraved
appetite, sickly and insipid; and he even resents the good opinion
entertained of his own integrity, as if it were an affront cast on the
masculine sense and spirit of his character. Thus, at the meeting
between Othello and Desdemona, he exclaims—‘Oh, you are well
tuned now: but I’ll set down the pegs that make this music, <i>as
honest as I am</i>’—deriving an indirect triumph over the want of
penetration in others from the consciousness of his own villainy.</p>

<p class='c014'>In most of the passages which we have hitherto quoted, Iago gives
a loose to his passion for theoretical evil: in the scenes with Othello,
where he has to put his theory in practice, with great risk to himself,
and with dreadful consequences to others, he is proportionably
guarded, insidious, dark and deliberate. In the very first scene with
Othello, he takes a very different tone;—that tone of hypocritical
virtue and affected delicacy, which always betrays the want of the
reality.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>‘<i>Enter Othello, Iago, and Attendants.</i></div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>But the part in which, according to our conception, Mr. Kean
failed most, was in the third act with Othello, where ‘comes the
tug of war.’ The following passage is, we think, decisive to our
purpose:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Iago.</i> My noble lord.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> What dost thou say, Iago?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Did Michael Cassio,</div>
      <div class='line'>When you woo’d my lady, know of your love?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> He did from first to last.</div>
      <div class='line'>Why dost thou ask?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> But for a satisfaction of my thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>No further harm.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> Why of thy thought, Iago?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> I did not think he had been acquainted with it.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> O yes, and went between us very oft—</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Indeed!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> Indeed! Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught of that?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is he not honest?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Honest, my Lord?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> Honest? Ay, honest.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> My Lord, for aught I know.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> What dost thou think?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> Think, my Lord!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Othello. Think, my Lord! Alas, thou echo’st me,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if there were some monster in thy thought</div>
      <div class='line'>Too hideous to be shewn. Thou dost mean something:</div>
      <div class='line'>I heard thee say even now, thou lik’dst not that—</div>
      <div class='line'>When Cassio left my wife. What did’st not like?</div>
      <div class='line'>And when I told thee, he was of my counsel,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of my whole course of wooing; thou criedst, indeed!</div>
      <div class='line'>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</div>
      <div class='line'>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</div>
      <div class='line'>Some horrible conceit: If thou dost love me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shew me thy thought.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> My Lord, you know I love you.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> I think thou dost:</div>
      <div class='line'>And for I know thou ‘rt full of love and honesty,</div>
      <div class='line'>And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</div>
      <div class='line'>For such things in a false disloyal knave</div>
      <div class='line'>Are tricks of custom: but in a man that’s just,</div>
      <div class='line'>They’re cold dilations working from the heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which passion cannot rule.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now, if there is any thing of superficial gaiety or heedlessness
in this, ‘it is not written in the bond:’—the breaks and stops, the
pursing and knitting of the brow together, the deep internal working
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>of hypocrisy under the mask of love and honesty, escaped us on the
stage.—The same observation applies to what he says afterwards of
himself:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</div>
      <div class='line'>As I confess it is my nature’s plague</div>
      <div class='line'>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</div>
      <div class='line'>Shapes faults that are not.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The candour of this confession would hardly be extorted from him,
if it did not correspond with the moody dissatisfaction, and suspicious,
creeping, cat-like watchfulness of his general appearance. The
anxious suspense, the deep artifice, the collected earnestness, and, if
we may so say, the <i>passion</i> of hypocrisy, are decidedly marked in
every line of the whole scene, and are worked up to a sort of
paroxysm afterwards, in that inimitably characteristic apostrophe:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘O Grace! O Heaven forgive me!</div>
      <div class='line'>Are you a man? Have you a soul or sense?</div>
      <div class='line'>God be wi’ you: take mine office. O wretched fool</div>
      <div class='line'>That lov’st to make thine honesty a vice!</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh monstrous world! take note, take note, O world!</div>
      <div class='line'>To be direct and honest, is not safe.</div>
      <div class='line'>I thank you for this profit, and from hence</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll love no friend, since love breeds such offence.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This burst of hypocritical indignation might well have called forth
all Mr. Kean’s powers, but it did not. We might multiply passages
of the same kind, if we had time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The philosophy of the character is strikingly unfolded in the part
where Iago gets the handkerchief:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>‘This may do something.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Moor already changes with my poisons,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,</div>
      <div class='line'>But with a little act upon the blood,</div>
      <div class='line'>Burn like the mines of sulphur.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We here find him watching the success of his experiment,
with the sanguine anticipation of an alchemist at the moment of
projection.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in28'>‘I did say so:</div>
      <div class='line'>Look where he comes’—[<i>Enter Othello</i>]—‘Not poppy nor mandragora,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep</div>
      <div class='line'>Which thou ow’dst yesterday.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Again he says:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>‘Work on:</div>
      <div class='line'>My medicine works; thus credulous fools are caught,</div>
      <div class='line'>And many worthy and chaste dames even thus</div>
      <div class='line'>All guiltless meet reproach.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>So that after all, he would persuade us that his object is only
to give an instructive example of the injustice that prevails in the
world.</p>

<p class='c014'>If he is bad enough when he has business on his hands, he is
still worse when his purposes are suspended, and he has only to
reflect on the misery he has occasioned. His indifference when
Othello falls in a trance, is perfectly diabolical, but perfectly in
character:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>Iago.</i> How is it, General? Have you not hurt your head?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Othello.</i> Dost thou mock me?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Iago.</i> I mock you not, by heaven,’ &amp;c.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The callous levity which Mr. Kean seems to consider as belonging
to the character in general, is proper here, because Iago has
no feelings connected with humanity; but he has other feelings
and other passions of his own, which are not to be trifled with.</p>

<p class='c014'>We do not, however, approve of Mr. Kean’s pointing to the
dead bodies after the catastrophe. It is not in the character of the
part, which consists in the love of mischief, not as an end, but
as a means, and when that end is attained, though he may feel no
remorse, he would feel no triumph. Besides, it is not the text of
Shakespear. Iago does not point to the bed, but Ludovico bids him
look at it:—‘Look on the tragic loading of this bed,’ &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c014'>We have already noticed that Edmund the Bastard is like an
episode of the same character, placed in less difficult circumstances.
Zanga is a vulgar caricature of it.</p>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>March 19, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We are not in the number of those who are anxious in recommending
the getting-up of Shakespear’s plays in general, as a duty which
our stage-managers owe equally to the author, and the reader of those
wonderful compositions. The representing the very finest of them
on the stage, even by the best actors, is, we apprehend, an abuse of
the genius of the poet, and even in those of a second-rate class, the
quantity of sentiment and imagery greatly outweighs the immediate
impression of the situation and story. Not only are the more refined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>poetical beauties and minuter strokes of character lost to the audience,
but the most striking and impressive passages, those which having once
read we can never forget, fail comparatively of their effect, except in
one or two rare instances indeed. It is only the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pantomime</span></i> part of
tragedy, the exhibition of immediate and physical distress, that which
gives the greatest opportunity for ‘inexpressible dumb-show and
noise,’ which is sure to tell, and tell completely on the stage. All
the rest, all that appeals to our profounder feelings, to reflection
and imagination, all that affects us most deeply in our closets, and
in fact constitutes the glory of Shakespear, is little else than an
interruption and a drag on the business of the stage. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Segnius per
aures demissa</span></i>, &amp;c. Those parts of the play on which the reader
dwells the longest, and with the highest relish in the perusal, are
hurried through in the performance, while the most trifling and
exceptionable are obtruded on his notice, and occupy as much time
as the most important. We do not mean to say that there is less
knowledge or display of mere stage-effect in Shakespear than in
other writers, but that there is a much greater knowledge and display
of other things, which divide the attention with it, and to which it
is not possible to give an equal force in the representation. Hence
it is, that the reader of the plays of Shakespear is almost always
disappointed in seeing them acted; and, for our own parts, we should
never go to see them acted, if we could help it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shakespear has embodied his characters so very distinctly, that he
stands in no need of the actor’s assistance to make them more
distinct; and the representation of the character on the stage almost
uniformly interferes with our conception of the character itself. The
only exceptions we can recollect to this observation, are Mrs. Siddons
and Mr. Kean—the former of whom in one or two characters, and
the latter, not certainly in any one character, but in very many
passages, have raised our imagination of the part they acted. It
may be asked then, why all great actors chuse characters from
Shakespear to come out in; and again, why these become their
favourite parts? First, it is not that they are able to exhibit their
author, but that he enables them to shew themselves off. The only
way in which Shakespear appears to greater advantage on the stage
than common writers is, that he stimulates the faculties of the actor
more. If he is a sensible man, he perceives how much he has to do,
the inequalities he has to contend with, and he exerts himself accordingly;
he puts himself at full speed, and lays all his resources under
contribution; he attempts more, and makes a greater number of
brilliant failures; he plays off all the tricks of his art to mimic
the poet; he does all he can, and bad is often the best. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>have before said that there are some few exceptions. If the genius
of Shakespear does not shine out undiminished in the actor, we
perceive certain effects and refractions of it in him. If the oracle
does not speak quite intelligibly, yet we perceive that the priest at
the altar is inspired with the god, or possessed with a demon. To
speak our minds at once, we believe that in acting Shakespear there
is a greater number of good things marred than in acting any other
author. In fact, in going to see the plays of Shakespear, it would
be ridiculous to suppose, that any one ever went to see Hamlet or
Othello represented by Kean or Kemble; we go to see Kean or
Kemble in Hamlet or Othello. On the contrary, Miss O’Neill and
Mrs. Beverley are, we take it, one and the same person. As to the
second point, viz. that Shakespear’s characters are decidedly
favourites on the stage in the same proportion as they are in the
closet, we deny it altogether. They either do not tell so much, or
very little more than many others. Mrs. Siddons was quite as great
in Mrs. Beverley and Isabella as in Lady Macbeth or Queen
Katherine: yet no one, we apprehend, will say that the poetry is
equal. It appears, therefore, not that the most intellectual characters
excite most interest on the stage, but that they are objects of greater
curiosity; they are nicer tests of the skill of the actor, and afford
greater scope for controversy, how far the sentiment is ‘overdone or
come tardy of.’ There is more in this circumstance than people in
general are aware of. We have no hesitation in saying, for instance,
that Miss O’Neill has more popularity <i>in the house</i> than Mr. Kean.
It is quite as certain, that he is more thought of <i>out of it</i>. The
reason is, that she is not ‘food for the critics,’ whereas Mr. Kean
notoriously is; there is no end of the topics he affords for discussion—for
praise and blame.</p>

<p class='c014'>All that we have said of acting in general applies to his Richard II.
It has been supposed that this is his finest part: this is, however, a
total misrepresentation. There are only one or two electrical shocks
given in it; and in many of his characters he gives a much greater
number.—The excellence of his acting is in proportion to the number
of hits, for he has not equal truth or purity of style. Richard II.
was hardly given correctly as to the general outline. Mr. Kean
made it a character of <i>passion</i>, that is, of feeling combined with
energy; whereas it is a character of <i>pathos</i>, that is to say, of feeling
combined with weakness. This, we conceive, is the general fault of
Mr. Kean’s acting, that it is always energetic or nothing. He is
always on full stretch—never relaxed. He expresses all the violence,
the extravagance, and fierceness of the passions, but not their misgivings,
their helplessness, and sinkings into despair. He has too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>much of that strong nerve and fibre that is always equally elastic.
We might instance to the present purpose, his dashing the glass down
with all his might, in the scene with Hereford, instead of letting it
fall out of his hands, as from an infant’s; also, his manner of
expostulating with Bolingbroke, ‘Why on thy knee, thus low, &amp;c.’
which was altogether fierce and heroic, instead of being sad, thoughtful,
and melancholy. If Mr. Kean would look into some passages
in this play, into that in particular, ‘Oh that I were a mockery king
of snow, to melt away before the sun of Bolingbroke,’ he would find
a clue to this character, and to human nature in general, which he
seems to have missed—how far feeling is connected with the sense of
weakness as well as of strength, or the power of imbecility, and the
force of passiveness.</p>

<p class='c014'>We never saw Mr. Kean look better than when we saw him in
Richard II. and his voice appeared to us to be stronger. We saw him
near, which is always in his favour; and we think one reason why the
Editor of this Paper<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c015'><sup>[32]</sup></a> was disappointed in first seeing this celebrated
actor, was his being at a considerable distance from the stage. We
feel persuaded that on a nearer and more frequent view of him, he
will agree that he is a perfectly original, and sometimes a perfectly
natural actor; that if his conception is not always just or profound,
his execution is masterly; that where he is not the very character he
assumes, he makes a most brilliant rehearsal of it: that he never
wants energy, ingenuity, and animation, though he is often deficient
in dignity, grace, and tenderness; that if he frequently disappoints us
in those parts where we expect him to do most, he as frequently
surprises us by striking out unexpected beauties of his own; and that
the objectionable parts of his acting arise chiefly from the physical
impediments he has to overcome.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of the other characters of the play, it is needless to say much.
Mr. Pope was respectable in John of Gaunt. Mr. Holland was
lamentable in the Duke of York, and Mr. Elliston indifferent in
Bolingbroke. This alteration of Richard II. is the best that has
been attempted; for it consists entirely of omissions, except one or
two scenes which are idly tacked on to the conclusion.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>April 2, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The English Drama has made an acquisition of no less than three
new pieces in the course of the week. The Unknown Guest (said
to be from the pen of Mr. Arnold, the Manager) is, we suppose, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>be considered as a dramatic trifle: it is one of the longest and dullest
trifles we almost ever remember to have sat out. We think in
general, that the practice of making the Manager bring out his
own pieces on the stage, is a custom which would be ‘more honoured
in the breach than the observance:’ it is offering a premium for the
rejection of better pieces than his own. In the present instance, it
would be a compliment to say, that the author has failed in wit,
character, incident, or sentiment; for he has not attempted any thing
of the kind. The dialogue bears no proportion in quantity to the
songs; and chiefly serves as a vehicle to tack together a certain
number of unmeaning lines, arranged for different voices, and set in
our opinion to very indifferent music. The music of this Opera
professes to be by Mr. Kelly and Mr. Braham, except that of one
song, which is modestly said to be—selected;—a title which we
apprehend might be extended to the whole. We do not recollect a
single movement in the airs composed by Mr. Kelly, which was not
familiar even to vulgarity; and the style of Mr. Braham’s songs has
no other object than to pamper him in his peculiar vices, and to
produce that <i>mannerism</i>, which is the destruction of all excellence in
art. There are two or three favourite passages which seem to dwell
upon his ear, and to which he gives a striking expression; these he
combines and repeats with laborious foolery; and in fact, sings
nothing but himself over and over continually. Nothing can be worse
than this affected and selfish monotony. Instead of acquiring new
and varied resources, by lending his imagination to the infinite
combinations of which music is susceptible, and by fairly entering
into his subject, all his ideas of excellence are taken from, and
confined to the sound of his own voice. It is on this account that
we listen to Mr. Braham’s singing with less pleasure than we formerly
did. It is not assuredly that Mr. Braham has fallen off in his
singing; on the contrary, he has improved and perfected his particular
talent, but we constantly know what we have to expect, or rather to
apprehend, for this anticipation at last amounts to apprehension: we
perceive a limit, and this perception is always painful, where it seems
to arise from any thing wilful or systematic. Those who first hear
Mr. Braham, are struck with a noble simplicity and fervour in his
manner of expressing certain emotions, in the eagerness with which
he seems to fling himself into his subject, disdaining the rules of art,
like the combatant who rushes without his armour to the battle: the
sounds he utters, appear to rend his own bosom, or at other times,
linger in fluttering accents on his lips. The communication between
the voice and the feelings is immediate, instantaneous, irresistible; and
the language of music seems the language of nature and passion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>But when the sound becomes not only an echo to the sense, but to
itself—when the same alternation of bursts of heroic passion, and
thrillings of sentimental tenderness is constantly played off upon us—when
there is nothing but this trite transition from the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con furio</span></i>,
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con strepito</span></i>, to the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">affettuoso</span></i> and <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">adagio</span></i> style, in their greatest extremes—we
then begin to perceive something like a trick, and are little
more affected than by reading the marginal directions in a music book.
The inspiration of genius is fled; that which before breathed the very
soul of music, becomes little better than a puppet, and like all other
puppets, is good only according to its compass, and the number of
evolutions it performs. We have here spoken of directness and
simplicity of style, as Mr. Braham’s <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">forte</span></i> in singing; for though we
agree that he has too much ornament (a very little is too much),
yet we can by no means allow that this can be made an unqualified
objection to his style, for he has much less than other singers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of Mr. Phillips we would not wish to speak; but as he puts
himself forward and is put forward by others, we must say something.
He is said to be an imitator of Mr. Braham; if so, the imitation is
a vile one. This gentleman has one qualification, which has been
said to be the great secret of pleasing others, that he is evidently
pleased with himself. But he does not produce a corresponding
effect upon us; we have not one particle of sympathy with his
wonderful self-complacency. We should wish never to hear him
sing again; or, if he must sing, at least, we should hope never to
see him act: let him not top his part—why should he sigh, and ogle,
and languish, and display all his accomplishments—he should spare
the side-boxes!—Mrs. Dickons never appeared to us any thing but
an ordinary musical instrument, and at present, she is very much out
of tune. We do not well understand what has been said of this
piece having called forth all the musical strength of the house: except
Braham’s, there was not a single song sung so as not to give pain,
even to a moderately cultivated ear. In this censure, we do not (of
course) include Miss Kelly; in seeing her, we never think of her
singing. The comic parts of this Opera (if such they can be called)
were sustained by Miss Kelly, Mr. Munden, and Mr. Knight. Miss
Kelly did the little she had to do, with that fine unobtrusive good
sense, and reluctant <i>naiveté</i>, which distinguish all her performances.
If she carries her shyness of the audience and of her profession to
a fault, not so Mr. Munden. He out-caricatures caricature, and
out-grimaces himself. We have seen him twice lately in the same
character of a drunken confidant, and were both times heartily tired.
He is not only perfectly conscious what he is about, but has a
thorough understanding with the audience all along. He makes his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>face up into a bad joke, and flings it right in the teeth of the
spectators. The expression of the masks hanging out at the shop-windows,
is less extravagant and distorted. There is no one on
the stage who can, or at least who does, draw up his eyebrows, roll
his eyes, thrust out his tongue, or drop his under jaw, in so astonishing
a manner as Mr. Munden; and if acting consisted in making wry
faces, he would be the greatest actor on the stage, instead of which
he is, on these occasions, only a bad clown. His over-desire to
produce effect, destroys all effect on our minds.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c015'><sup>[33]</sup></a>—Mr. Knight played
the servant very well; but in general, there is too much an appearance
in his acting, as if he was moved by wires. His feeling always flies
to the extremities: his vivacity is in his feet and finger-ends. He is
a very lively automaton.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean played for his benefit on Wednesday, the character of
Zanga, in the Revenge (which he is to repeat), and the character
of Abel Drugger from the Alchymist, (we are sorry to say for that
night only). The house was crowded to excess. The play of the
Revenge is an obvious transposition of Othello: the two principal
characters are the same; only their colours are reversed. The giving
the dark, treacherous, fierce, and remorseless character to the Moor,
is an alteration, which is more in conformity to our prejudices, as
well as to historical truth. We have seen Mr. Kean in no part, to
which his general style of acting is so completely adapted as to this,
or to which he has given greater spirit and effect. He had all the
wild impetuosity of barbarous revenge, the glowing energy of the
untamed children of the sun, whose blood drinks up the radiance of
fiercer skies. He was like a man stung with rage, and bursting with
stifled passions. His hurried motions had the restlessness of the
panther’s: his wily caution, his cruel eye, his quivering visage, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>violent gestures, his hollow pauses, his abrupt transitions, were all in
character. The very vices of Mr. Kean’s general acting might
almost be said to assist him in the part. What in our judgment he
wants, is dignified repose, and deep internal sentiment. But in
Zanga, nothing of this kind is required. The whole character is
violent; the whole expression is in action. The only passage which
struck us as one of calm and philosophical grandeur, and in which
Mr. Kean failed from an excess of misplaced energy, was the one in
the conclusion, where he describes the tortures he is about to undergo,
and expresses his contempt for them. Certainly, the predominant
feeling here is that of stern, collected, impenetrable fortitude, and the
expression given to it should not be that of a pantomimic exaggeration
of the physical horrors to which he professes to rise superior. The
mind in such a situation recoils upon itself, summons up its own
powers and resources, and should seem to await the blow of fate with
the stillness of death. The scene in which he discloses himself to
Alonzo, and insults over his misery, was terrific: the attitude in
which he tramples on the body of his prostrate victim, was not the
less dreadful from its being perfectly beautiful. Among the finest
instances of natural expression, were the manner in which he interrupts
himself in his relation to Alonzo, ‘I knew you could not
bear it,’ and his reflection when he sees that Alonzo is dead—‘And
so is my revenge.’ The play should end here: the soliloquy afterwards
is a mere drawling piece of common-place morality. We
ought to add, that Mr. Rae acted the part of Alonzo with great
force and feeling.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Kean’s Abel Drugger was an exquisite piece of ludicrous
<i>naiveté</i>. The first word he utters, ‘<i>Sure</i>,’ drew bursts of laughter
and applause. The mixture of simplicity and cunning in the character
could not be given with a more whimsical effect. First, there was
the wonder of the poor Tobacconist, when he is told by the Conjurer
that his name is Abel, and that he was born on a Wednesday; then
the conflict between his apprehensions and his cupidity, as he becomes
more convinced that Subtle is a person who has dealings with the
devil; and lastly, his contrivances to get all the information he can,
without paying for it. His distress is at the height, when the two-guinea
pocket-piece is found upon him: ‘He had received it from his
grandmother, and would fain save it for his grand-children.’ The
battle between him and Face (Oxberry) was irresistible; and he
went off after he had got well through it, strutting, and fluttering his
cloak about, much in the same manner that a game cock flaps his wings
after a victory. We wish he would do it again!</p>

<div class='c026'><i>June 4, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Bannister had the comedy of The World, and the after-piece
of The Children in the Wood, for his benefit on Thursday last, at
Drury-Lane. Mr. Gattie, in consequence of the indisposition of
Mr. Dowton, undertook the part of Index in the play. This alteration
occasioned a short interruption; but after the usual explanation,
the piece proceeded, and in our opinion, Mr. Gattie made a very
excellent representative of the busy, whiffling, insignificant, but good-natured
character which he personated. The figure and manner of
this actor are certainly better fitted for the part than those of Dowton,
who has too much weight and sturdiness of mind and body, to run
about on ladies’ errands, and take an interest in every thing that does
not concern him. He is not a Will Wimble. Mr. Bannister played
the character of Echo, which is a whimsical mixture of simplicity,
affectation, and good-nature, with his usual excellence. Mr. Elliston’s
Cheviot is one of his best characters. Whatever requires spirit,
animation, or the lively expression of natural feelings, he does well.
Sentimental comedy is the equivocal reflection of tragedy in common
life, and Mr. Elliston can rehearse the one just well enough to play
the other. The coincidence is complete. He raises his voice to
a pitch of romantic rapture, or lowers it to the tones of sullen
despondence and disappointment, with the happiest effect. The
Duke, in the Honey-Moon, is the <i>assumption</i> of an impassioned
character. The Comedy of the World, is one of the most ingenious
and amusing of the modern stage. It has great neatness of dialogue,
and considerable originality, as well as sprightliness of character. It
is, however, chargeable with a grossness which is common to modern
plays, we mean, the grossness of fashionable life in the men, and the
grossness of fine sentiment in the women. Mrs. Davison did not
soften down the exuberant qualities of Lady Bloomfield into any
thing like decency; and the two fashionable loungers, Loiter and
Dauntless, were certainly done to the life by Decamp and R. Palmer.
Between the acts, Mr. Braham sung Robin Adair, and The Death
of Nelson, in his most delightful style.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the after-piece, Mr. Bannister played the favourite part of
Walter, in the Children in the Wood, for the last time.</p>

<p class='c014'>He then came forward to take his leave of the Stage, in a Farewell
Address, in which he expressed his thanks for the long and flattering
patronage he had received from the public. We do not wonder that
his feelings were overpowered on this occasion: our own (we confess
it) were nearly so too. We remember him in the first hey-day of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>our youthful spirits, in The Prize—which he played so delightfully
with that fine old croaker Suett, and Madame Storace—in the farce
of My Grandmother, in the Son-in-Law, in Autolycus, and in Scrub,
in which our satisfaction was at its height. At that time, King, and
Parsons, and Dodd, and Quick, and Edwin, were in the full vigour
of their reputation, who are now all gone! We still feel the vivid
delight with which we used to see their names in the play-bills, as we
went along to the theatre. Bannister was almost the last of these
that remained; and we parted with him as we should with one of
our oldest and best friends. The most pleasant feature in the profession
of a player, and which is peculiar to it, is, that we not only
admire the talents of those who adorn it, but we contract a personal
intimacy with them. There is no class of society whom so many
persons regard with affection as actors. We greet them on the stage;
we like to meet them in the streets; they always recall to us pleasant
associations; and we feel our gratitude excited, without the uneasiness
of a sense of obligation. The very gaiety and popularity, however,
which surrounds the life of a favourite performer, makes the retiring
from it a very serious business. It glances a mortifying reflection on
the shortness of human life, and the vanity of human pleasures.
Something reminds us, that ‘all the world’s a stage, and all the men
and women merely players.’</p>

<h3 class='c008'>COMUS</h3>
<div class='lg-container-l c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><cite>The Examiner.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>June 11, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Comus has been got up at Covent-Garden Theatre with great
splendour, and has had as much success as was to be expected. The
genius of Milton was essentially <i>undramatic</i>: he saw all objects from
his own point of view, and with certain exclusive preferences. Shakespear,
on the contrary, had no personal character, and no moral
principle, except that of good-nature. He took no part in the scene
he describes, but gave fair play to all his characters, and left virtue
and vice, folly and wisdom, right and wrong, to fight it out between
themselves, just as they do on their ‘old prize-fighting stage’—the
world. He is only the vehicle for the sentiments of his characters.
Milton’s characters are only a vehicle for his own. Comus is a
didactic poem, or a dialogue in verse, on the advantages or disadvantages
of virtue and vice. It is merely a discussion of general
topics, but with a beauty of language and richness of illustration, that
in the perusal leave no feeling of the want of any more powerful
interest. On the stage, the poetry of course lost above half of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>effect: but this was compensated to the audience by every advantage
of scenery and decoration. By the help of dance and song, ‘of mask
and antique pageantry,’ this most delightful poem went off as well as
any common pantomime. Mr. Conway topped the part of Comus
with his usual felicity, and seemed almost as if the genius of a
maypole had inspired a human form. He certainly gives a totally
new idea of the character. We allow him to be ‘a marvellous
proper man,’ but we see nothing of the magician, or the son of
Bacchus and Circe in him. He is said to make a very handsome
Comus: so he would make a very handsome Caliban; and the
common sense of the transformation would be the same. Miss
Stephens played the First Nymph very prettily and insipidly; and
Miss Matthews played the Second Nymph with appropriate significance
of nods and smiles. Mrs. Faucit, as the Lady, rehearsed the
speeches in praise of virtue very well, and acted the scene of the
Enchanted Chair admirably. She seemed changed into a statue of
alabaster. Miss Foote made a very elegant Younger Brother.—It is
only justice to add, that Mr. Duruset gave the songs of the Spirit
with equal taste and effect; and in particular, sung the final invocation
to Sabrina in a full and powerful tone of voice, which we have
seldom heard surpassed.</p>

<p class='c014'>These kind of allegorical compositions are necessarily unfit for
actual representation. Every thing on the stage takes a literal,
palpable shape, and is embodied to the sight. So much is done by
the senses, that the imagination is not prepared to eke out any
deficiency that may occur. We resign ourselves, as it were, to the
illusion of the scene: we take it for granted, that whatever happens
within that ‘magic circle’ is real; and whatever happens without it,
is nothing. The eye of the mind cannot penetrate through the glare
of lights which surround it, to the pure empyrean of thought and
fancy; and the whole world of imagination fades into a dim and
refined abstraction, compared with that part of it, which is brought
out dressed, painted, moving, and breathing, a speaking pantomime
before us. Whatever is seen or done, is sure to tell: what is heard
only, unless it relates to what is seen or done, has little or no effect.
All the fine writing in the world, therefore, which does not find its
immediate interpretation in the objects or situations before us, is at
best but elegant impertinence. We will just take two passages out
of Comus, to shew how little the beauty of the poetry adds to the
interest on the stage: the first is from the speech of the Spirit as
Thyrsis:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘This evening late, by then the chewing flocks</div>
      <div class='line'>Had ta’en their supper on the savoury herb</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Of knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,</div>
      <div class='line'>I sat me down to watch upon a bank</div>
      <div class='line'>With ivy canopied, and interwove</div>
      <div class='line'>With flaunting honeysuckle, and began,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy,</div>
      <div class='line'>To meditate my rural minstrelsy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till Fancy had her fill; but ere a close,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wonted roar was up amidst the woods,</div>
      <div class='line'>And filled the air with barbarous dissonance:</div>
      <div class='line'>At which I ceased, and listen’d them a while,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till an unusual stop of sudden silence</div>
      <div class='line'>Gave respite to the drowsy-flighted steeds</div>
      <div class='line'>That draw the litter of close-curtain’d sleep:</div>
      <div class='line'>At last a soft and solemn breathing sound</div>
      <div class='line'>Rose like a steam of rich distill’d perfumes,</div>
      <div class='line'>And stole upon the air, that even Silence</div>
      <div class='line'>Was took ere she was ‘ware, and wished she might</div>
      <div class='line'>Deny her nature, and be never more</div>
      <div class='line'>Still to be so displaced.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This passage was recited by Mr. Duruset; and the other, which
we proposed to quote, equally became the mouth of Mr. Conway:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Two such I saw, what time the labour’d ox</div>
      <div class='line'>In his loose traces from the furrow came,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the swinkt hedger at his supper sat;</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw them under a green mantling vine</div>
      <div class='line'>That crawls along the side of yon small hill,</div>
      <div class='line'>Plucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots:</div>
      <div class='line'>Their port was more than human as they stood:</div>
      <div class='line'>I took it for a fairy vision</div>
      <div class='line'>Of some gay creatures of the element,</div>
      <div class='line'>That in the colours of the rainbow live</div>
      <div class='line'>And play in th’ plighted clouds. I was awe-struck,</div>
      <div class='line'>And as I pass’d, I worshipp’d.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>To those of our readers who may not be acquainted with Comus,
these exquisite passages will be quite new, though they may have
lately heard them on the stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was an evident want of adaptation to theatrical representation
in the last scene, where Comus persists in offering the Lady the
cup, which she as obstinately rejects, without any <i>visible</i> reason. In
the poetical allegory, it is the poisoned cup of pleasure: on the stage,
it is a goblet filled with wine, which it seems strange she should
refuse, as the person who presents it to her, has certainly no appearance
of any dealings with the devil.</p>

<p class='c014'>Milton’s Comus is not equal to Lycidas, nor to Samson Agonistes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>It wants interest and passion, which both the others have. Lycidas
is a fine effusion of classical sentiment in a youthful scholar: his
Samson Agonistes is almost a canonisation of all the high moral and
religious prejudices of his maturer years. <i>We</i> have no less respect
for the memory of Milton as a patriot than as a poet. Whether he
was a <i>true</i> patriot, we shall not enquire: he was at least a <i>consistent</i>
one. He did not retract his defence of the people of England; he
did not say that his sonnets to Vane or Cromwell were meant
ironically; he was not appointed Poet-Laureat to a Court which he
had reviled and insulted; he accepted neither place nor pension; nor
did he write paltry sonnets upon the ‘Royal fortitude’ of the House
of Stuart, by which, however, they really lost something.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c015'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c008'>MR. KEAN’S LEON</h3>

<div class='c026'><i>July 2, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We went to see Mr. Kean in Leon, at Drury-Lane, and, on the
whole, liked him less in it than we formerly liked Mr. Kemble in
the same part. This preference, however, relates chiefly to personal
considerations. In the first scenes of the play, Mr. Kemble’s face
and figure had a nobleness in them, which formed a contrast to the
assumed character of the idiot, and thus carried off the disgusting
effect of the part. Mr. Kean both acted and looked it too well.
At the same time, we must do justice to the admirable comic talents
displayed by Mr. Kean on this occasion. We never saw or heard
looks or tones more appropriate and ludicrous. The house was in a
roar. His alarm on being first introduced to his mistress, his profession
of being ‘very loving,’ his shame after first saluting the lady,
and his chuckling half-triumph on the repetition of the ceremony,
were complete acting. Above all, we admired the careless self-complacent
idiotcy with which he marched in, carrying his wife’s
fan, and holding up her hand. It was the triumph of folly. Even
Mr. Liston, with all his inimitable graces in that way, could not
have bettered it. In the serious part of the character he appeared
to us less perfect. There was not repose enough, not enough of
dignity. Leon, we apprehend, ought to be the man of spirit, but
still more the gentleman. He has to stand in general upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>defensive, upon his own rights, upon his own ground, and need not
bluster, or look fierce. We will mention one instance in particular.
Where he tells the Duke to leave the house, which we think he
should do with perfect coolness and confidence, he pointed with his
finger to the door, ‘There, there,’ with the same significant inveteracy
of manner, as where, in Iago, he points to the dead body of Othello.
The other parts of the play were well supported. Mrs. Glover
deserves great praise for her Estifania. Mr. Bartley shewed both
judgment and humour in the Copper Captain; and yet we were not
satisfied with his performance. There is a thinness in his voice, and
a plumpness in his person, neither of which is to our taste. His
laughing when he finds that Cacafogo had been cheated by Estifania,
was perfectly well done; but there was an effeminacy in his voice
which took away from the hearty effect which Bannister used to give
to this scene. Knight, in the old woman, was excellent. His
reiteration of ‘What?’ in answer to the Copper Captain’s questions,
had the startling effect produced by letting off a pistol close at one’s
ears. It evidently proceeded from a person blest with ‘double
deafness’ of body and mind. The morality of this excellent comedy
is very indifferent; and having been prompted by the observations of
some persons of fashion near us, we got into a train of agreeable
reflections on the progressive refinement of this our age and country,
which it was our intention to have communicated to our readers,—but
that we dropt them in the lobbies!</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c008'>THE TEMPEST</h3>
<div class='lg-container-l c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><cite>The Examiner.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>July 23, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>As we returned some evenings ago from seeing the Tempest at Covent-Garden,
we almost came to the resolution of never going to another
representation of a play of Shakespear’s as long as we lived; and we
certainly did come to this determination, that we never would go <i>by
choice</i>. To call it a representation, is indeed an abuse of language:
it is travestie, caricature, any thing you please, but a representation.
Even those daubs of pictures, formerly exhibited under the title of
the Shakespear Gallery, had a less evident tendency to disturb and
distort all the previous notions we had imbibed from reading Shakespear.
In the first place, it was thought fit and necessary, in order
to gratify the sound sense, the steady, sober judgment, and natural
unsophisticated feelings of Englishmen a hundred years ago, to
modernize the original play, and to disfigure its simple and beautiful
structure, by loading it with the common-place, clap-trap sentiments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>artificial contrasts of situations and character, and all the heavy tinsel
and affected formality which Dryden had borrowed from the French
school. And be it observed, further, that these same anomalous,
unmeaning, vulgar, and ridiculous additions, are all that <i>take</i> in the
present farcical representation of the Tempest. The beautiful, the
exquisitely beautiful descriptions in Shakespear, the still more refined,
and more affecting sentiments, are not only not applauded as they
ought to be (what fine murmur of applause should do them justice?)—they
are not understood, nor are they even heard. The lips of
the actors are seen to move, but the sounds they utter exciting no
corresponding emotions in the breast, are no more distinguished than
the repetition of so many cabalistical words. The ears of the
audience are not prepared to drink in the music of the poet; or grant
that they were, the bitterness of disappointment would only succeed
to the stupor of indifference.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shakespear has given to Prospero, Ariel, and the other characters
in this play, language such as wizards and spirits, ‘the gay creatures
of the element,’ might want to express their thoughts and purposes,
and this language is here put into the mouth of Messrs. Young,
Abbott, and Emery, and of Misses Matthews, Bristow, and Booth.
‘’Tis much.’ Mr. Young is in general what is called a respectable
actor. Now, as this is a phrase which does not seem to be very
clearly understood by those who most frequently use it, we shall take
this opportunity to define it. A respectable actor then, is one who
seldom gratifies, and who seldom offends us; who never disappoints
us, because we do not expect any thing from him, and who takes
care never to rouse our dormant admiration by any unlooked-for
strokes of excellence. In short, an actor of this class (not to speak
it profanely) is a mere machine, who walks and speaks his part;
who, having a tolerable voice, face, and figure, reposes entirely and
with a prepossessing self-complacency on these natural advantages:
who never risks a failure, because he never makes an effort; who
keeps on the safe side of custom and decorum, without attempting
improper liberties with his art; and who has not genius or spirit
enough to do either well or ill. A respectable actor is on the stage,
much what a pretty woman is in private life, who trusts to her outward
attractions, and does not commit her taste or understanding, by
hazardous attempts to shine in conversation. So we have generals,
who leave every thing to be done by their men; patriots, whose
reputation depends on their estates; and authors, who live on the
stock of ideas they have in common with their readers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Such is the best account we can give of the class of actors to which
Mr. Young belongs, and of which he forms a principal ornament. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>long as he contents himself to play indifferent characters, we shall say
nothing: but whenever he plays Shakespear, we must be excused if
we take unequal revenge for the martyrdom which our feelings suffer.
His Prospero was good for nothing; and consequently, was indescribably
bad. It was grave without solemnity, stately without dignity,
pompous without being impressive, and totally destitute of the wild,
mysterious, preternatural character of the original. Prospero, as
depicted by Mr. Young, did not appear the potent wizard brooding
in gloomy abstraction over the secrets of his art, and around whom
spirits and airy shapes throng numberless ‘at his bidding;’ but
seemed himself an automaton, stupidly prompted by others: his
lips moved up and down as if pulled by wires, not governed by
the deep and varied impulses of passion; and his painted face, and
snowy hair and beard, reminded us of the masks for the representation
of Pantaloon. In a word, Mr. Young did not personate Prospero,
but a pedagogue teaching his scholars how to recite the part, and not
teaching them well.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of one of the actors who assisted at this sacrifice of poetical
genius, Emery, we think as highly as any one can do: he is indeed,
in his way, the most perfect actor on the stage. His representations
of common rustic life have an absolute identity with the thing
represented. But the power of his mind is evidently that of imitation,
not that of creation. He has nothing romantic, grotesque, or
imaginary about him. Every thing in his hands takes a local and
habitual shape. Now, Caliban is a mere creation; one of the
wildest and most abstracted of all Shakespear’s characters, whose
deformity is only redeemed by the power and truth of the imagination
displayed in it. It is the essence of grossness, but there is not
the smallest vulgarity in it. Shakespear has described the brutal
mind of this man-monster in contact with the pure and original forms
of nature; the character grows out of the soil where it is rooted
uncontrouled, uncouth, and wild, uncramped by any of the meannesses
of custom. It is quite remote from any thing provincial; from the
manners or dialect of any county in England. Mr. Emery had
nothing of Caliban but his gaberdine, which did not become him.
(We liked Mr. Grimaldi’s Orson much better, which we saw
afterwards in the pantomime.) Shakespear has, by a process of
imagination usual with him, drawn off from Caliban the elements of
every thing etherial and refined, to compound them into the unearthly
mould of Ariel. Nothing was ever more finely conceived than this
contrast between the material and the spiritual, the gross and delicate.
Miss Matthews played and sung Ariel. She is to be sure a very
‘tricksy spirit:’ and all that we can say in her praise is, that she is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>a better representative of the sylph-like form of the character, than
the light and portable Mrs. Bland, who used formerly to play it.
She certainly does not sing the songs so well. We do not however
wish to hear them sung, though never so well; no music can add
any thing to their magical effect.—The words of Shakespear would
be sweet, even ‘after the songs of Apollo!’</p>

<div class='c026'><i>July 30, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Haymarket is the most sociable of all our theatres. A
wonderful concentration of interest, and an agreeable equality of
pretension reign here. There is an air of unusual familiarity between
the audience and the actors; the pit shakes hands with the boxes,
and the galleries descend, from the invisible height to which they
are raised at the other theatres, half-way into the orchestra. Now
we have certain remains of a sneaking predilection for this mode of
accommodating differences between all parts of the house; this average
dissemination of comfort, and immediate circulation of enjoyment;
and we take our places (just as it happens), on the same good terms
with ourselves and our neighbours, as we should in sitting down to an
ordinary at an inn. Every thing, however, has its drawbacks; and
the Little Theatre in the Haymarket is not without them. If, for
example, a party of elderly gentlewomen should come into a box
close at your elbow, and immediately begin to talk loud, with an
evident disregard of those around them, your only chance is either to
quit the house altogether, or (if you really wish to hear the play),
to remove to the very opposite side of it; for the ill-breeding of
persons of that class, sex, and time of life, is incorrigible. At the
great Theatres, it is sometimes very difficult to hear, for the noise
and quarrelling in the gallery; here the only interruption to
the performance is from the overflowing garrulity and friendly
tittle-tattle of the boxes. The gods (as they are called), at Drury-lane
and Covent-garden, we suspect, ‘keep such a dreadful pudder
o’er our heads,’ from their impatience at not being able to hear what
is passing below; and, at the minor theatres, are the most quiet and
attentive of the audience.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is the immemorial practice of the Haymarket Theatre to bring
out, every season, a number of new pieces, good, bad, or indifferent.
To this principle we are indebted for an odd play, with an odd title,
‘My Wife! What Wife?’ and whether it belongs to the class of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>good, bad, or indifferent, we could not make up our minds at the
time, and it has nearly escaped our memory since. Whether from
its excellences or its absurdities, it is altogether very amusing. The
best part of it is a very unaccountable, easy, impudent, blundering
Irish footman, admirably represented by Mr. Tokely, whom we here
take the liberty of introducing to the notice of our readers. ‘Good
Mr. Tokely, we desire better acquaintance with you.’ We do not
know whether this gentleman is himself an Irishman, but he has a
wonderful sympathy with the manners and peculiarities of the
character he had to represent. The ease, the ignorance, the
impudence, the simplicity, the cunning, the lying, the good-nature,
the absurdity, and the wit of the common character of the Irish,
were depicted with equal fidelity and <i>naiveté</i> by this very lively
actor; and his <i>brogue</i> was throughout a complete accompaniment to
the sense. It floated up and down, and twisted round, and rose and
fell, and started off or rattled on, just as the gusts of passion led.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Irish and the Scotch brogue are very characteristic. In the
one, the words are tumbled out altogether: in the other, every
syllable is held fast between the teeth and kept in a sort of undulating
suspense, lest circumstances should require a retractation before the
end of the sentence. The Irish character is impetuous: the Scotch
circumspect. The one is extreme unconsciousness, the other extreme
consciousness. The one depends almost entirely on animal spirits,
the other on will; the one on the feeling of the moment, the other
on the calculation of consequences. The Irish character is therefore
much more adapted for the stage: it presents more heterogeneous
materials, and it is only unconscious absurdity that excites laughter.
We seldom see a Scotchman introduced into an English farce:
whereas an Irishman is always ready to be served up, and it is a
standing dish at this kind of entertainment. Mr. Tokely sung two
songs in the afterpiece with great effect. The laughing song was a
thing of pure execution, made out of nothing but the feeling of humour
in the actor.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Terry played the principal serious character in ‘My Wife!
What Wife?’ He is a very careful and judicious actor: but his
execution overlays the character. He is a walking grievance on the
stage; a robust personification of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comedie larmoyante</span></i>; a rock
dropping tears of crystal; an iron figure, ‘in the likeness of a sigh.’
Mr. Jones was intended as a lively set-off to Mr. Terry. It was
but a diversity of wretchedness. Mr. Jones is no favourite of ours.
He is always the same Mr. Jones, who shews his teeth, and rolls
his eyes,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And looks like a jackdaw just caught in a snare.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Mr. Meggett has played Octavian twice at this theatre. He is a
very decent, disagreeable actor, of the second or third-rate, who
takes a great deal of pains to do ill. He did not, however, deserve
to be hissed, and he only deserves to be applauded, because he was
hissed undeservedly. He is a Scotch edition of Conway, without
his beauty, and without his talent for noisy declamation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our play-houses are just now crowded with French people, with
or without white cockades. A very intelligent French man and
woman sat behind us the other evening at the representation of the
Mountaineers, (one of the best of our modern plays) who were
exceedingly shocked at the constant transitions from tragic to comic
in this piece. It is strange that a people who have no keeping in
themselves, should be offended at our want of keeping in theatrical
representations. But it is an old remark, that the manners of every
nation and their dramatic taste are opposite to each other. In the
present instance, there can be no question, but that the distinguishing
character of the English is gravity, and of the French levity. How
then is it that this is reversed on the stage? Because the English
wish to relieve the continuity of their feelings by something light
and even farcical, and the French cannot afford to offer the same
temptation to their natural levity. They become grave only by
system, and the formality of their artificial style is resorted to as
a preservative against the infection of their national disposition. One
quaint line in a thousand sad ones, operating on their mercurial and
volatile spirits, would turn the whole to farce. The English are
sufficiently tenacious of strong passion to retain it in spite of other
feelings: the French are only tragic by the force of dulness, and
every thing serious would fly at the appearance of a jest.</p>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>August 6, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Harley is an addition to the comic strength of the Lyceum.
We have not seen him in the part of Leatherhead, in The Blue
Stocking, in which he has been much spoken of; but as an
intriguing knave of a servant, he was the life of a very dull and
incredible farce, which came out the other night under the title of
My Aunt; and we afterwards liked him still better as Fidget, in
The Boarding House, where he had more scope for his abilities.
He gave the part with all the liveliness, insinuating complaisance,
and volubility of speech and motion, which belong to it. He has
a great deal of vivacity, archness, and that quaint extravagance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>which constitutes the most agreeable kind of buffoonery. We think
it likely he will become a considerable favourite with the public;
and the more so, because he is not only a very amusing actor, but
also possesses those recommendations of face, person, and manner,
which go a great way in conciliating public favour. These are the
more necessary in those burlesque characters, which have little
foundation in real life, and which, as they serve chiefly to furnish
opportunities for the drollery of the actor to display itself, bring him
constantly before us in his personal capacity.</p>

<p class='c014'>We are really glad to be pleased whenever we can, and we were
pleased with Peter Fidget. His dress and his address are equally
comic and in character. He wears a white morning jean coat,
and a white wig, the curls of which hang down like lappets over
his shoulders, and form a good contrast with the plump, rosy,
shining face beneath it. He comes bolt upon the stage, and jumps
into the good graces of the audience before they have time to defend
themselves. Peter Fidget, ‘master of a boarding-house, with a
green door—brass knocker—No. 1, round the corner—facing the
Steyne—Brighton’—is a very impudent, rattling fellow, with a
world of business and cares on his back, which however it seems
broad enough to bear, the lightness of whose head gets the better
of the heaviness of his heels, and whose person thrives in proportion
to his custom. It is altogether a very laughable exaggeration, and
lost none of its effect in the hands of Mr. Harley.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the new farce of My Aunt, Mr. Wallack played the character
of a fashionable rake, and he is said to have played it well. If this
is a good specimen of the class, we can only say we do not wish to
extend our acquaintance with it; for we never saw any thing more
disagreeable. Miss Poole played the Niece to Mrs. Harlowe’s
Aunt; and seemed a very proper niece for such an aunt. Mr. Pyne
‘warbled his love-lorn ditties all night long;’—for a despairing lover,
we never saw any one look better, or flushed with a more purple
grace—‘as one incapable of his own distress.’ He appears to have
taken a hint from Sir John Suckling;—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Prythee, why so pale, fond lover,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Prythee why so pale?</div>
      <div class='line'>Will, if looking well won’t win her,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Looking ill prevail?</div>
      <div class='line'>Prythee, why so pale?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We went to the Haymarket Theatre on Thursday, to see Mr.
Meggett in the Iron Chest, with that laudable desire which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>always feel to find out any error in our former opinions; but in
this desire, as it generally happens, we were disappointed. We
however consider Mr. Meggett’s Sir Edward Mortimer as a much
more successful delineation than his Octavian. The character is
taken from Falkland, in Mr. Godwin’s Caleb Williams, which is
unquestionably the best modern novel. The character, as it
is treated by Colman, is one of much less genius and elevation
than the original. It is harsh, heavy, fierce, and painfully irritable,
but at the same time forcible and affecting. Such, at least, was the
impression we received from Mr. Meggett’s representation of it.
What this actor wants is genial expression, and a certain general
impulse which is inseparable from all passion. The tide of feeling
in him frets itself away in narrow nooks and estuaries. His habitual
manner is too hard and dry—he makes too dead a set at every
thing. He grinds his words out between his teeth as if he had
a lockjaw, and his action is clenched till it resembles the commencement
of a fit of the epilepsy. He strains his muscles till he seems
to have lost the use of them. If Mr. Kemble was hard, Mr.
Meggett is rigid, to a petrifying degree. We however think that
he gave considerable force and feeling to the part, by the justness
of his conception, and by the energy of his execution. But neither
energy nor good sense is sufficient to make the great actor:—it
requires genius, which nothing can give. Study may teach us to
distinguish the forms and classes of things; but it is genius alone
which puts us in possession of the powers of art or nature. This
play, when it first came out, excited a great deal of idle controversy
and vulgar abuse. It appears to us to be a play of great interest;
but that interest depends upon the sentiment, and not on the story
or situations, and consequently is very little understood by a mixed
audience.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Greville made an interesting representative of Helen, the
mistress of Sir Edward Mortimer. Mr. Barnard had considerable
merit in Wilford, the Caleb Williams of the piece; though he
seemed somewhat too insignificant an instrument to produce such
terrible effects. Mr. Tokely played the ruffian (Orson) admirably
well. Mrs. Belfield, his Dulcinea in the gang of robbers, perfectly
frightened us in the cave-scene. We felt as much disconcerted by
the uncalled-for phrensy of this theatrical amazon, as the Squire of
Dames in Spenser did, when he was carried off by the giantess,
Ogygia; or, as Mr. Capel Lofft must have done the other day,
when Mrs. Mary Ann Bulmer pounced upon him in the Chronicle.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Foote was the brother of Sir Edward Mortimer. This
gentleman is of the Wroughton school; that is, he belongs to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>old English class of honest country gentlemen, who abound more
in good nature than good sense, and who have a most plentiful lack
of gall and wit. Mr. Foote does not discredit this branch of the
profession. These persons are always very comfortable in themselves,
and busy about other people. This is exceedingly provoking. They
speak with good emphasis and discretion, and are in general of a
reasonable corpulence. Whenever we see an actor of this class,
with a hat and feather, a gold belt, and more than ordinary merit,
we are strangely reminded of our old friend Mr. Gyngell, the
celebrated itinerant manager, and the only showman in England,
who, after the festivity of the week, makes a point of staying the
Sunday over, and goes with all his family to church.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>August 13, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A new Comedy, called Living in London, by the author (as it
appears) of Love and Gout, has been brought forward at the
Haymarket Theatre. It is in three acts. The first act promised
exceedingly well. The scenes were well-contrived, and the dialogue
was neat and pointed. But in the second and third, the comic
invention of the writer seemed to be completely exhausted; his
plot became entangled and ridiculous, and he strove to relieve the
wearied attention of the audience, by some of the most desperate
attempts at <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i> we ever remember. Thus a servant is
made to say, that ‘no one can <i>bring up</i> his master’s dinner but
himself.’ We are told by very good authority, that ‘want of decency
is want of sense.’ The plot is double, and equally ill-supported
in both its branches. A lady of fashion (who was made as little
disgusting as the part would permit by Miss Greville) makes overtures
of love to a nobleman, (Lord Clamourcourt, Mr. Foote), by publishing
an account of a supposed intrigue between herself and him in the
newspapers. The device is new, at least. The same nobleman is
himself made jealous of his wife by the assumption of her brother’s
name (Neville) by a coxcomb of his acquaintance, by the circumstance
of a letter directed to the real Neville having been received by
the pretended one, and by the blunders which follow from it. The
whole developement of the plot is carried on by letters, and there is
hardly a scene towards the conclusion, in which a footman does not
come in, as the bearer of some alarming piece of intelligence. Lord
Clamourcourt, just as he is sitting down to dinner with his wife,
receives a letter from his mistress; he hurries away, and his Lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>having no appetite left, orders the dinner back. Lord Clamourcourt
is no sooner arrived at the place of assignation than he receives an
anonymous letter, informing him that Neville is at his house, and he
flies back on the wings of jealousy, as he had come on those of love.
All this is very artificial and improbable. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod sic mihi ostendis
incredulus odi.</span></i></p>

<p class='c014'>We were a good deal disappointed in this play, as from the
commencement we had augured very favourably of it. There was
not much attempt to draw out the particular abilities of the actors;
and the little that there was, did not succeed. Matthews, who is in
general exceedingly amusing, did not appear at all to advantage.
The author did not seem to understand what use to make of him.
He was an automaton put into his hands, of which he did not know
how to turn the pegs. He is shoved on, and then shoved off the
stage to no purpose, as if his exit or his entrance made the jest. One
person twirls him round by the flap of his coat, and another jerks him
back again by the tail of his periwig. He is first a stupid servant,
and is next metamorphosed, without taking his degrees, into an
ignorant doctor. He changes his dress, but the same person remains.
He has nothing to do but to run about like a dog to fetch and carry,
or to fidget over the stage like the dolls that dance (to please the
children) to the barrel-organs in the street. For our own parts, we
had rather see Punch and the puppet-shew.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Aug. 27, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A new Opera was brought out at the Lyceum, last week, called
The King’s Proxy; or Judge for yourself. If we were to judge for
ourselves, we should conceive that Mr. Arnold must have dreamt this
opera. It might be called the Manager’s Opera. It is just what
might be supposed to occur to him, nodding and half asleep in his
arm-chair after dinner, having fatigued himself all the morning with
ransacking the refuse of the theatre for the last ten years. In this
dozing state, it seems that from the wretched fragments strewed on
the floor, the essence of four hundred rejected pieces flew up and
took possession of his brain, with all that is thread-bare in plot, lifeless
in wit, and sickly in sentiment. Plato, in one of his immortal
dialogues, supposes a man to be shut up in a cave with his back to the
light, so that he sees nothing but the shadows of men passing and
repassing on the wall of his prison. The Manager of the Lyceum
Theatre appears to be much in the same situation. He does not get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>a single glimpse of life or nature, but as he has seen it represented on
his own boards, or conned it over in his manuscripts. The apparitions
of gilded sceptres, painted groves and castles, wandering damsels,
cruel fathers and tender lovers, float in incessant confusion before
him. His characters are the shadows of a shade; but he keeps a
very exact inventory of his scenery and dresses, and can always
command the orchestra.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Arnold may be safely placed at the head of a very prevailing
class of poets. He writes with the fewest ideas possible; his meaning
is more nicely balanced between sense and nonsense, than that of any
of his competitors; he succeeds from the perfect insignificance of his
pretensions, and fails to offend through downright imbecility. The
story of the present piece, (built on the well-known tradition of the
Saxon King who was deceived by one of his courtiers in the choice
of his wife), afforded ample scope for striking situation and effect;
but Mr. Arnold has perfectly neutralised all interest in it. In this
he was successfully seconded by those able associates, Mr. and Mrs.
T. Cooke, Mr. Pyne, Mr. Wallack, by the sturdy pathos of
Fawcett, and Miss Poole’s elegant dishabille. One proof of talent
the author has shewn, we allow—and that is, he has contrived to
make Miss Kelly disagreeable in the part of Editha. The only
good thing in the play was a dance by Miss Luppino and Miss
C. Bristow.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Sept. 3, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A piece has been brought out at the Lyceum, called the Maid and
the Magpie, translated from the French, and said to be founded on a
true story of a girl having been condemned for a theft, which was
discovered after her death to have been committed by a magpie. The
catastrophe is here altered. The play itself is a very delightful little
piece. It unites a great deal of lightness and gaiety with an equal
degree of interest. The dialogue is kept up with spirit, and the story
never flags. The incidents, though numerous and complicated with
a number of minute circumstances, are very clearly and artfully connected
together. The spirit of the French stage is manifest through
the whole performance, as well as its superiority to the general run of
our present dramatic productions. The superiority of our old comedy
to the French (if we make the single exception of Moliere) is to be
traced to the greater variety and originality of our national characters.
The French, however, have the advantage of us in playing with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>common-place surface of comedy, in the harlequinade of surprises and
escapes, in the easy gaiety of the dialogue, and in the delineation of
character, neither insipid nor overcharged.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole piece was excellently cast. Miss Kelly was the life of
it. Oxberry made a very good Jew. Mrs. Harlowe was an
excellent representative of the busy, bustling, scolding housewife; and
Mr. Gattie played the Justice of the Peace with good emphasis and
discretion. The humour of this last actor, if not exceedingly powerful,
is always natural and easy. Knight did not make so much of his
part as he usually does.</p>

<div class='c026'>(<i>Drury-Lane</i>) <i>Sept. 17, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Tartuffe, the original of the Hypocrite, is a play that we do
not very well understand. Still less do we understand the Hypocrite,
which is taken from it. In the former, the glaring improbability of
the plot, the absurdity of a man’s imposing on the credulity of another
in spite of the evidence of his senses, and without any proof of the
sincerity of a religious charlatan but his own professions, is carried off
by long formal speeches and dull pompous casuistry. We find our
patience tired out, and our understanding perplexed, as if we were sitting
by in a court of law. If there is nothing of nature, at least there is
enough of art, in the French play. But in the Hypocrite (we mean
the principal character itself), there is neither the one nor the other.
Tartuffe is a plausible, fair-spoken, long-winded knave, who if he does
not convince, confounds his auditors.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the Hypocrite of Bickerstaff, the insidious, fawning, sophistical,
accomplished French Abbé is modernised into a low-lived, canting,
impudent Methodist preacher; and this was the character which Mr.
Dowton represented, we must say, too well. Dr. Cantwell is a
sturdy beggar, and nothing more: he is not an impostor, but a bully.
There is not in any thing that he says or does, in his looks, words or
actions, the least reason that Sir John Lambert should admit him into
his house and friendship, suffer him to make love to his wife and
daughter, disinherit his son in his favour, and refuse to listen to any
insinuation or proof offered against the virtue and piety of his
treacherous inmate. In the manners and institutions of the old French
<i>regime</i>, there was something to account for the blind ascendancy
acquired by the good priest over his benefactor, who might have submitted
to be cuckolded, robbed, cheated, and insulted, as a tacit proof
of his religion and loyalty. The inquisitorial power exercised by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Church was then so great, that a man who refused, to be priest-ridden,
might very soon be suspected of designs against the state. This is at
least the best account we can give of the tameness of Orgon. But in
this country, nothing of the kind could happen. A fellow like Dr.
Cantwell could only have got admittance into the kitchen of Sir John
Lambert—or to the ear of old Lady Lambert. The animal
magnetism of such spiritual guides, is with us directed against the
weaker nerves of our female devotees.</p>

<p class='c014'>We discovered nothing in Mr. Dowton’s manner of giving the
part to redeem its original improbability, or gloss over its obvious
deformity. His locks are combed down smooth over his shoulders;
but he does not sufficiently ‘sleek o’er his rugged looks.’ His tones,
except where he assumes the whining twang of the conventicle, are
harsh and abrupt. He sometimes exposes his true character prematurely
and unnecessarily, as where he is sent to Charlotte with a
message from her father. He is a very vulgar, coarse, <i>substantial</i>
hypocrite. His hypocrisy appears to us of that kind which arises
from ignorance and grossness, without any thing of refinement or
ability, which yet the character requires. The cringing, subtle,
accomplished master-villain, the man of talent and of the world, was
wanting. It is, in a word, just that sort of hypocrisy which might
supply a lazy adventurer in the place of work, which he might live
and get fat upon, but which would not enable him to conduct plots
and conspiracies in high life. We do not say that the fault is in
Mr. Dowton. The author has attempted to amalgamate two contradictory
characters, by engrafting our vulgar Methodist on the
courtly French impostor; and the error could not perhaps be
remedied in the performance. The only scene which struck us as in
Mr. Dowton’s best manner, as truly masterly, was that in which he
listens with such profound indifference and unmoved gravity to the
harangue of Mawworm. Mr. Dowton’s general excellence is in
hearty ebullitions of generous and natural feeling, or in a certain
swelling pride and vain glorious exaggerated ostentation, as in Major
Sturgeon, and not in constrained and artificial characters.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mawworm, which is a purely local and national caricature, was
admirably personated by Oxberry. Mrs. Sparks’s old Lady
Lambert, is, we think, one of the finest exhibitions of character
on the stage. The attention which she pays to Dr. Cantwell, her
expression of face and her fixed uplifted hands, were a picture which
Hogarth might have copied. The effects of the <i>spirit</i> in reviving the
withered ardour of youth, and giving a second birth to forgotten
raptures, were never better exemplified. Mrs. Orger played young
Lady Lambert as well as the equivocal nature of the part would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>admit; and Miss Kelly was as lively and interesting as usual in
Charlotte. Of Mr. Wallack we cannot speak so favourably as some
of our contemporaries. This gentleman ‘has honours thrust upon
him’ which he does not deserve, and which, we should think, he
does not wish. He has been declared, by the first authority, to
stand at the head of his profession in the line of genteel comedy. It
is usual, indeed, to congratulate us on the accession of Mr. Wallack
at the expence of Mr. Decamp, but it is escaping from Scylla to
Charybdis. We are glad to have parted with Mr. Decamp, and should
not be inconsolable for the loss of Mr. Wallack.</p>

<p class='c014'>The best thing we remember in Mr. Coleridge’s tragedy of
Remorse, and which gave the greatest satisfaction to the audience,
was that part in which Decamp was precipitated into a deep pit, from
which, by the elaborate description which the poet had given of it,
it was plainly impossible he should ever rise again. If Mr. Wallack
is puffed off and stuck at the top of his profession at this unmerciful
rate, it would almost induce us to wish Mr. Coleridge to write
another tragedy, to dispose of him in the same way as his
predecessor.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Oct. 1, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A Mr. Edwards, who has occasionally played at private theatricals,
appeared at Covent-Garden Theatre in the character of Richard the
Third. It was one of those painful failures, for which we are so
often indebted to the managers. How these profound judges, who
exercise ‘sole sway and sovereignty’ over this department of the
public amusements, who have it in their power to admit or reject
without appeal, whose whole lives have been occupied in this one
subject, and whose interest (to say nothing of their reputation) must
prompt them to use their very best judgment in deciding on the pretensions
of the candidates for public favour, should yet be so
completely ignorant of their profession, as to seem not to know the
difference between the <i>best</i> and the <i>worst</i>, and frequently to bring
forward in the most arduous characters, persons whom the meanest
critic in the pit immediately perceives to be totally disqualified for the
part they have undertaken—is a problem which there would be some
difficulty in solving. It might suggest to us also, a passing suspicion
that the same discreet arbiters of taste suppress real excellence in the
same manner as they obtrude incapacity on the notice of the public, if
genius were not a thing so much rarer than the want of it.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>If Mr. Edwards had shewn an extreme ignorance of the author,
but had possessed the peculiar theatrical requisites of person, voice,
and manner, we should not have been surprised at the managers
having been deceived by imposing appearances. But Mr. Edwards
failed, less from a misapprehension of his part, than from an entire
defect of power to execute it. If every word had been uttered with
perfect propriety (which however was very far from being the case)
his gestures and manner would have made it ridiculous. Of personal
defects of this kind, a man cannot be a judge of himself; and his
friends will not tell him. The managers of a play-house are the only
persons who can screen any individual, possessed with an unfortunate
theatrical <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mania</span></i>, from exposing himself to public mortification and
disgrace for the want of those professional qualifications of which they
are supposed to be infallible judges.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the same Theatre, a lady of the name of Hughes has been
brought out in Mandane, in the favourite Opera of Artaxerxes—we
should hope, not in the place of Miss Stephens. We do not say
this for the sake of any invidious comparison, but for our own sakes,
and for the sake of the public. Miss Hughes is, we believe, a very
accomplished singer, with a fine and flexible voice, with considerable
knowledge and execution. But where is the sweetness, the simplicity,
the melting soul of music? There was a voluptuous delicacy, a
<i>naiveté</i> in Miss Stephens’s singing, which we have never heard before
nor since, and of which we should be loth to be deprived. Her
songs in Mandane lingered on the ear like an involuntary echo to the
music—as if the sentiment were blended with and trembled on her
voice. This was particularly the case in the two delightful airs, ‘If
o’er the cruel tyrant love,’ and ‘Let not rage thy bosom firing.’ In
the former of these, the notes faultered and fell from her lips like
drops of dew from surcharged flowers. If it is impossible to be
a judge of music without understanding it as a science, it is still more
impossible to be so without understanding the sentiment it is intended
to convey. Miss Hughes declaimed and acted these two songs,
instead of singing them. She lisps, and smiles, and bows, and
overdoes her part constantly. We do not think Mandane is at all
the heroine she represents her—or, if she is, we do not wish to see
her. This lady would do much better at the Opera.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Duruset sung ‘Fair Semira’ with taste and feeling. We
wish, in hearing the song ‘In infancy our hope and fears,’ we could
have forgotten Miss Rennell’s simple, but sustained and impressive
execution of it.—Mr. Taylor played Arbaces, instead of Mr.
Incledon.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lovers’ Vows has been brought forward at Drury-Lane Theatre,
and a young lady of the name of Mardyn has appeared in the
character of Amelia Wildenheim. Much has been said in her
praise, and with a great deal of justice. Her face is handsome,
and her figure is good, bordering (but not too much), on <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i>.
There is, also, a full luscious sweetness in her voice, which was
in harmony with the sentiments she had to express. The whole
of this play, which is of German origin, carries the romantic in
sentiment and story to the extreme verge of decency as well as
probability. The character of Amelia Wildenheim is its principal
charm. The open, undisguised simplicity of this character is,
however, so enthusiastically extravagant, as to excite some little
surprise and incredulity on an English stage. The portrait is too
naked, but still it is the nakedness of innocence. She lets us see
into the bottom of her heart, but there is nothing there which she
need wish to disguise. Mrs. Mardyn did the part very delightfully—with
great spirit, truth, and feeling. She, perhaps, gave it a
greater maturity of consciousness than it is supposed to possess.
Her action is, in general, graceful and easy, but her movements
were, at times, too youthful and unrestrained, and too much like
<i>waltzing</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Glover and Mr. Pope did ample justice to the principal
<i>moral</i> characters in the drama; and we were perfectly satisfied with
Mr. Wallack in Anhalt, the tutor and lover of Amelia. Some of
the situations in this popular play (let the critics say what they
will of their extravagance), are very affecting, and we will venture
our opinion, that more tears were shed on this one occasion, than
there would be at the representation of Hamlet, Othello, Lear, and
Macbeth, for a whole season. This is not the fault of Shakespeare,
but neither is it the fault of Kotzebue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Dowton came out for the first time in the character of
Shylock, in the Merchant of Venice. Our own expectations were
not raised very high on this occasion, and they were not disappointed.
All the first part of the character, the habitual malignity of Shylock,
his keen sarcasms and general invectives, were fully understood, and
given with equal force and discrimination. His manner of turning
the bond into a ‘merry jest,’ and his ironical indifference about it,
were an improvement which Mr. Dowton had borrowed from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>comic art. But when the character is brought into action, that is,
when the passions are let loose, and excited to the highest pitch of
malignity, joy, or agony, he failed, not merely from the breaking
down of his voice, but from the want of that movement and tide of
passion, which overcomes every external disadvantage, and bears
down every thing in its course. We think Mr. Dowton was wrong
in several of his conceptions in the trial scene and other places, by
attempting too many of those significant distinctions, which are only
natural and proper when the mind remains in its ordinary state, and
in entire possession of its faculties. Passion requires the broadest
and fullest manner possible. In fine, Mr. Dowton gave only the
prosaic side of the character of Shylock, without the poetical
colouring which belongs to it and is the essence of tragic acting.
Mr. Lovegrove was admirable in Launcelot Gobbo. The scene
between him and Wewitzer, as Old Gobbo, was one of the richest
we have seen for a long time. Pope was respectable as Antonio.
Mr. Penley’s Gratiano was more remarkable for an appearance of
folly than of gaiety.</p>

<div class='c026'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>October 15, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Why can we not always be young, and seeing the School for
Scandal? This play used to be one of our great theatrical treats in
our early play-going days. What would we not give to see it once
more, as it was then acted, and with the same feelings with which
we saw it then? Not one of our old favourites is left, except little
Simmons, who only served to put us in mind more strongly of what
we have lost! Genteel comedy cannot be acted at present. Little
Moses, the money-lender, was within a hair’s-breadth of being the
only person in the piece who had the appearance or manners of a
gentleman. There was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">retenu</span></i> in the conduct of his cane and hat,
a precision of dress and costume, an idiomatic peculiarity of tone, an
exact propriety both in his gestures and sentiments, which reminded us
of the good old times when every one belonged to a marked class in
society, and maintained himself in his characteristic absurdities by a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-fris</span></i> of prejudices, forms, and ceremonies. Why do our
patriots and politicians rave for ever about the restoration of the good
old times? Till they can persuade the beaux in Bond-street to
resume their swords and bag-wigs, they will never succeed.</p>

<p class='c014'>When we go to see a Comedy of the past age acted on the modern
stage, we too almost begin to ‘cast some longing, lingering looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>behind,’ at the departed sword-knots and toupees of the age of
Louis XIV. We never saw a play more completely vulgarised in
the acting than this. What shall we say of Fawcett, who played
Sir Peter Teazle with such formidable breadth of shoulders and
strength of lungs? Or to Mrs. Dobbs, who made such a pretty,
insipid little rustic of Lady Teazle, shewing her teeth like the
painted dolls in a peruke-maker’s window? Or to Mrs. Gibbs,
who converted the delicacy of Mrs. Candour into the coarseness of
a bar-maid? Or to Mr. Blanchard, whose face looked so red, and
his eyes so fierce in Old Crabtree, and who seemed to have mistaken
one of his stable-boys for his nephew, Sir Benjamin? Or (not to
speak it profanely) to Mr. Young’s Joseph Surface? Never was
there a less prepossessing hypocrite. Mr. Young, indeed, puts on a
long, disagreeable, whining face, but he does not hide the accomplished,
plausible villain beneath it. Jack Palmer was the man.
No one ever came so near the idea of what the women call ‘a fine
man.’ With what an air he trod the stage!—With what pomp he
handed Lady Teazle to a chair! With what elaborate duplicity
he knelt to Maria! Mr. Young ought never to condescend to play
comedy, nor aspire to play tragedy. Sentimental pantomime is his
forte. Charles Kemble made the best Charles Surface we have
seen. He acted this difficult character (difficult because it requires
a union of so many requisites, a good face and figure, easy manners,
evident good nature, animation and sensibility) in such a way as to
make it truly interesting and delightful. The only fault we can find
with him is, that he was not well dressed.—Mrs. Faucit was respectable
in Lady Sneerwell. Mr. Terry, as Sir Oliver Surface, wore a
great coat with yellow buttons. Mr. Farley, in Trip, had a large
bouquet: and why should we refuse to do justice to Mr. Claremont,
who was dressed in black? The School for Scandal is one of the
best Comedies in our language (a language abounding in good
Comedies), and it deserves either to be well acted, or not acted at
all. The wit is inferior to Congreve’s, and the allusions much
coarser. Its great excellence is in the invention of comic situations,<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c015'><sup>[35]</sup></a>
and the lucky contrast of different characters. The satirical conversation
at Lady Sneerwell’s, is an indifferent imitation of The Way of
the World, and Sir Benjamin Backbite a foolish superfluity from the
older comedy. He did not need the aid of Mr. Tokely to make
him ridiculous. We have already spoken well of this actor’s talents
for low humour, but if he wishes to remain on the establishment, we
are afraid he must keep in the kitchen.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>October 22, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A Lady of the name of Alsop, a daughter of Mrs. Jordan (by a
former husband), has appeared at Covent-Garden Theatre, in the
character of Rosalind. Not only the circumstance of her relationship
to that excellent actress, but the accounts in the papers, raised our
curiosity and expectations very high. We were unwillingly disappointed.
The truth is, Mrs. Alsop is a very nice little woman,
who acts her part very sensibly and cleverly, and with a certain
degree of arch humour, but ‘no more like her mother than we to
Hercules.’ When we say this, we mean no disparagement to this
lady’s talents, who is a real acquisition to the stage in correct and
chaste acting, but simply to prevent comparisons, which can only
end in disappointment. Mrs. Alsop would make a better Celia than
Rosalind. Mrs. Jordan’s excellences were all natural to her. It
was not as an actress but as herself, that she charmed every one.
Nature had formed her in her most prodigal humour: and when
nature is in the humour to make a woman all that is delightful,
she does it most effectually. Mrs. Jordan was the same in all her
characters, and inimitable in all of them, because there was no one
else like her. Her face, her tones, her manner were irresistible.
Her smile had the effect of sunshine, and her laugh did one good to
hear it. Her voice was eloquence itself: it seemed as if her heart
was always at her mouth. She was all gaiety, openness, and good-nature.
She rioted in her fine animal spirits, and gave more pleasure
than any other actress, because she had the greatest spirit of enjoyment
in herself. Her Nell—but we will not tantalize ourselves or
our readers. Mrs. Alsop has nothing luxurious about her, and Mrs.
Jordan was nothing else. Her voice is clear and articulate, but not
rich or flowing. In person she is small, and her face is not
prepossessing. Her delivery of the speeches was correct and
excellent as far as it went, but without much richness or power.
Lively good sense is what she really possesses. She also sung the
Cuckoo Song very pleasingly.</p>

<p class='c014'>Charles Kemble made an interesting Orlando. Mr. Young spoke
the ‘Seven Ages’ with propriety, and some effect. Mr. Fawcett’s
Touchstone was decent; and Mrs. Gibbs in Audrey, the very thing
itself.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mrs. Mardyn appeared at Drury-Lane Theatre in the play of The
Will. We like her better than ever. She has still an exuberance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>in her manner and action, which might be spared. She almost <i>dances</i>
the character. She is, or she looks, very handsome; is perfectly
well made, and has a very powerful voice, of which she makes full
use. With a little more elegance, a little more decorum, a little
more restraint upon the display of her charms, she would be the
most fascinating comic actress on the stage. We cannot express the
only fault we have to find with her better than by saying, that we
think her manner was perfectly in character in her boy’s clothes.
The scene with Deborah, where she was frightened by the supposed
ghost, had wonderful effect. Mr. Wallack played the young tutor
as if he had been chaplain to a bishop. Lovegrove’s humour in the
old steward was feeble: it would not reach the galleries.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>October 29, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>John Du Bart is said to have made a great noise in his life-time;
but it was nothing to the noise he makes at present at Covent-Garden
Theatre, with his good ship Fame, and his gallant son Francis.
We very much doubt, whether the vessel in which the great John
forced his way out of Dunkirk harbour, was equal in size to the one
in which Mr. Farley pipes all hands on board, and assaults the
chandeliers and side-boxes of the Theatre-Royal. The ladies, like
so many Andromedas, were thrown into evident consternation at the
approach of this sea-monster. To what a degree of perfection the
useful and elegant arts must have been carried in a country, where
a real ship, as large as the life, can be brought on the stage, to the
amazement and confusion of the audience! Speaking within compass,
the man of war which is now got up at Covent-Garden, is full as
large as any of the flotilla which last year ploughed the bosom of
the Serpentine River, and the sea-fight with which the Managers
have favoured us before Christmas, is as interesting as that which
took place in Hyde Park, between the English and American
squadrons, under the tasteful direction of the Prince Regent. We
pronounce this the most nonsensical farce (with the exception
perhaps of the one just alluded to) we were ever present at. The
utmost that the poet or the mechanist could have aspired to, must
have been to produce the effects of a first sea-voyage. There lay
the ship of John Du Bart for half an hour, rocking about on crape
waves, with the sun rising on one side, and night coming on in
a thunder-storm on the other, guns firing, and the orchestra playing;
Mr. Farley on board, bawling himself hoarse, looking like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>master of a Dutch squabber, or still more like the figure at the
mast-head; Miss Booth as busy as she could make herself; Mr.
Treby and Mr. Truman doing nothing; Mr. Hamerton with a hat
and feathers, as the Crown Prince of Poland; Mr. Tokely very
much at home drinking punch, and Mr. Liston (the only sensible
man on board) wishing himself in any other situation. If any
thing were wanting to complete the dizziness of brain produced by
all this, it was supplied by the music of Mr. Bishop, who kept firing
a perpetual broadside on the ears of the audience. From the overture
to the finale, we heard nothing but</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Guns, drums, trumpets, blunderbuss, and thunder!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Never since the invention of French Operas was there such an
explosion of dissonant sounds. If this is music, then the clashing of
bells, the letting off of rockets and detonating balls, or the firing
a pistol close at your ear on an illumination night, is music. John
Du Bart is taken from the French; and from the plot and sentiments,
it is not difficult to guess the date of the French piece. It turns
upon the preference due to an elected over an hereditary prince;
and the chief actors are made to utter such sentiments as this, that
‘treason consists in supporting a monarch on the throne in opposition
to the voice of the people.’ We wonder it is suffered to be acted—since
<i>the hundred days</i> are over!</p>

<div class='c026'><i>November 6, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We are glad to announce another interesting Polly at Drury-Lane
Theatre, in the person of Miss Nash, from the Theatre-Royal, Bath.
We are glad of every thing that facilitates the frequent representation
of that inimitable play, the Beggar’s Opera, which unites those two
good things, sense and sound, in a higher degree than any other
performance on the English or (or as far as we know) on any
other stage. It is to us the best proof of the good sense as well
as real delicacy of the British public, to see the most beautiful
women in the boxes and the most veteran critics in the pit,
whenever it is acted. All sense of humanity must be lost before
the Beggar’s Opera can cease to fill the mind with delight and
admiration.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Nash is tall, elegantly formed, in the bloom of youth, and
with a very pretty face. Her voice has great sweetness, flexibility,
and depth. Her execution is scientific, but gracefully simple; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>she sang the several songs with equal taste and feeling. Her action,
though sufficiently chaste and correct, wanted ease and spirit, so that
the general impression left on the spectator’s imagination was that of
a very beautiful alabaster figure which had been taught to sing. She
was greeted in the most encouraging manner on her first appearance,
and rapturously applauded throughout. Indeed the songs and the
music are so exquisite in themselves, that if given with their genuine
characteristic simplicity, they cannot fail to delight the most insensible
ear. The songs to which she gave most sweetness and animation
were those beginning, ‘But he so teazed me’—‘Why how now,
saucy Jade’—and ‘Cease your funning.’ Her mode of executing
the last was not certainly so delightful as the way in which Miss
Stephens sings it, but it was still infinitely delightful. Her low notes
are particularly fine. They have a deep, mellow richness, which we
have never heard before in a female voice. The sound is like the
murmuring of bees.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss Kelly played Lucy, and we need hardly add, that she played
it well. She is a charming little vixen: has the most agreeable pout
in the world, and the best-humoured smile; shews all the insolence
of lively satisfaction, and when she is in her airs, the blood seems
to tingle at her fingers’ ends. Her expression of triumph when
Macheath goes up to her rival, singing ‘Tol de rol lol,’ and her
vexation and astonishment when he turns round upon her in the same
manner, were admirable. Her acting in this scene was encored;
that is to say, Mr. Cooke’s song was encored for the sake of the
acting. She is the best Lucy we have seen, except Mrs. Charles
Kemble, who, though she did not play the part more naturally, did
it with a higher spirit and greater <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of Mr. T. Cooke’s Macheath, we cannot say any thing favourable.
Indeed, we do not know any actor on the stage who is enough of the
fine gentleman to play it. Perhaps the elder Kemble might, but then
he is no singer! It would be an experiment for Mr. Kean: but we
don’t think he could do it. This is a paradox; but we will explain.
As close a resemblance, then, as the dress of the ladies in the private
boxes bears to that of that of the ladies in the boxes which are not
private, so nearly should the manners of Gay’s Macheath resemble
those of the fine gentleman. Mr. Harley’s Filch is not good.
Filch is a serious, contemplative, conscientious character. This
Simmons perfectly understands, as he does every character that he
plays. He sings the song, ‘’Tis woman that seduces all mankind,’
as if he had a pretty girl in one eye, and the gallows in the other.
Mr. Harley makes a joke of it. Mrs. Sparkes’s Mrs. Peachum we
hardly think so good as Mrs. Davenport’s.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Munden spoils Peachum, by lowering the character into broad
farce. He does not utter a single word without a nasal twang,
and a distortion of his face and body. Peachum is an old rogue,
but not a buffoon. Mr. Dowton’s Lockitt was good, but it is
difficult to play this part after Emery, who in the hard, dry, and
impenetrable, has no rival. The scene where Dowton and Munden
quarrel, and exchange wigs in the scuffle, was the best. They were
admirably dressed. A hearty old gentleman in the pit, one of the
old school, enthusiastically called out, ‘Hogarth, by G—d!’ The
ladies in the scene at the tavern with Macheath were genteeler than
usual. This we were pleased to see; for a great deal depends on
the casting of that scene. How Gay must have chuckled, when
he found it once fairly over, and the house in a roar! They leave
it out at Covent-Garden, from the systematic attention which is paid
there to the morals of the town!</p>

character of Elwina, in Miss Hannah More’s tragedy of Percy.
‘Although this production,’ says a critic in the Times, ‘like every
other of the excellent and enlightened author, affords equal pleasure
and instruction in the perusal, we are not sure that it was ever
calculated to obtain very eminent success upon the stage. The
language is undoubtedly classical and flowing; the sentiment characteristically
natural and pure; the fable uninterrupted; the catastrophe
mournful; and the moral of unquestionable utility and truth. With
all these requisites to dramatic fortune, the tragedy of Percy does
not so strongly rivet the attention, as some other plays less free from
striking faults, and composed by writers of far less distinguished
talent. Though the versification be sufficiently musical, and in many
passages conspicuous for nerve as well as cadence, there is no splendid
burst of imagery, nor lofty strain of poetical inspiration. Taste and
intelligence have decked their lines in every grace of sculptured
beauty: we miss but the presence of that Promethean fire, which
could bid the statue ‘speak.’ It may be objected, moreover, to this
drama, that its incidents are too few, and too little diversified. The
grand interest which belongs to the unlooked-for preservation of
Percy’s life, is, perhaps, too soon elicited and expended: and if we
mistake not, there is room for doubting whether, at length, he fairly
met his death, or was ensnared once more by some unworthy treachery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>of Douglas. Neither do we think the passions which are called into
play by the solemn events of a history so calamitous, have been very
minutely traced, intensely coloured, or powerfully illustrated. We
have a general impression that Douglas is racked by jealousy—Elwina
by grief—and Percy by disappointment. But we fain would have
the home touches of Shakespear.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus far the Times critic: from all which it appears that Miss
Hannah More is not like Shakespear. The writer afterwards tries
his hand at a comparison between Miss More and Virgil; and the
result, after due deliberation, is, that Virgil was the wiser man. The
part, however, to which the learned commentator has the most decided
objection, is that ‘where Elwina steps out of her way to preach rather
a lengthy sermon to her father, against war in general, as offensive to
the Prince of Peace.’—Now if this writer had thought proper, he
might have discovered that the whole play is ‘a lengthy sermon,’
without poetry or interest, and equally deficient in ‘sculptured grace,
and Promethean fire.’—We should not have made these remarks,
but that the writers in the above paper have a greater knack than any
others, of putting a parcel of tall opaque words before them, to blind
the eyes of their readers, and hoodwink their own understandings.
There is one short word which might be aptly inscribed on its
swelling columns—it is the word which Burchell applies to the
conversation of some high-flown female critics in the Vicar of
Wakefield.</p>

<p class='c014'>But to have done with this subject. We shall not readily forgive
Miss Hannah More’s heroine Elwina, for having made us perceive
what we had not felt before, that there is a considerable degree of
manner and monotony in Miss O’Neill’s acting. The peculiar
excellence which has been ascribed to Miss O’Neill (indeed over
every other actress) is that of <i>faultless nature</i>. Mrs. Siddons’s acting
is said to have greater grandeur, to have possessed loftier flights of
passion and imagination; but then it is objected, that it was not a
pure imitation of nature. Miss O’Neill’s recitation is indeed nearer
the common standard of level speaking, as her person is nearer the
common size, but we will venture to say that there is as much a
tone, a certain stage sing-song in her delivery as in Mrs. Siddons’s.
Through all the tedious speeches of this play, she preserved the
same balanced artificial cadence, the same melancholy tone, as if
her words were the continued echo of a long-drawn sigh. There is
the same pitch-key, the same alternation of sad sounds in almost
every line. We do not insist upon perfection in any one, nor do
we mean to decide how far this intonation may be proper in tragedy;
but we contend, that Miss O’Neill does not in general speak in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>natural tone of voice, nor as people speak in conversation. Her
great excellence is extreme natural sensibility; that is, she perfectly
conceives and expresses what would be generally felt by the female
mind in the extraordinary and overpowering situations in which she
is placed. In truth, in beauty, and in that irresistible pathos, which
goes directly to the heart, she has at present no equal, and can have
no superior. There were only one or two opportunities for the
display of her delightful powers in the character of Elwina, but
of these she made the fullest use. The expression of mute grief,
when she hears of the death of Percy, in the last act, was as fine
as possible: nor could any thing be more natural, more beautiful or
affecting, than the manner in which she receives his scarf, and
hurries out with it, tremulously clasping it to her bosom. It was
one of those moments of still, and breathless passion, in which the
tongue is silent, while the heart breaks. We did not approve of
her dying scene at all. It was a mere convulsive struggle for breath,
the representation of a person in the act of suffocation—one of those
agonies of human nature, which, as they do not appeal to the imagination,
should not certainly be obtruded on the senses. Once or twice
Miss O’Neill dropped her voice so low, and articulated so internally,
that we gathered what she said rather from the motion of her lips,
than from distinguishing the sound. This in Mr. Kean would be
called extravagance. We were heartily glad when the play was
over. From the very construction of the plot, it is impossible that
any good can come of it till all the parties are dead; and when this
catastrophe took place, the audience seemed perfectly satisfied.</p>

</table>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The story is not easily told, for it is a story almost destitute of
events. Sir Harry Moreden has been for some years married to
an heiress, a woman of exemplary principles and amiable feelings;
but who, as it appears, through no other misconduct than a little
playful gaiety of manner, has so far provoked the capricious and
irritable temper of her husband, that he writes off to General
Torrington, her guardian, gravely proposing a separation. This
letter brings the General down from London, in order to learn
from the Baronet his real cause of quarrel with his wife; and a
singular conversation ensues, in which, to every conjecture of the
General’s as to the nature of Lady M.’s offences, the unaccountable
husband answers in the negative, leaving it to the discernment of her
guardian to find out the actual source of his disquietude. This, it
appears, in the course of the play, is a certain fashionable levity and
sportiveness of manner, with which it is rather extraordinary that Sir
Harry should be displeased, as another objection on which he sometimes
dwells is the rusticity of his wife’s taste, in not having any
inclination for the dissipation and frivolities of a town life. Some
improbable scenes are however introduced to explain the merits of
this matrimonial question, in which the studied levity on one side is
contrasted with the unconscious violence on the other, until at length
Lady Moreden, hearing from her guardian that her husband is much
embarrassed in his circumstances, and almost on the point of ruin,
reproaches herself with her thoughtless habit of tormenting him; and
prevails upon the General to concur with her in applying her own
large fortune, left to her separately by her father’s will, to the
relief of her husband’s distresses: at the moment when Sir Harry
is complaining of his not knowing ‘where to find a friend,’ all his
applications to those whom he had considered such having proved
unsuccessful, her guardian introduces his wife to him, which produces
the reconciliation between them, and gives rise to the title of the
play.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the progress and developement of this story there is very little
to interest or surprise: the sentimental part of the comedy is founded
on the story of Heartly, whose daughter Maria has run away from
him, and been privately married to a man of fashion, but who having,
for family reasons, enjoined secresy upon her in his absence abroad,
subjects her, in her father’s eyes, to the supposed disgrace of a
criminal connection. Old Heartly retires into the country in a
melancholy state of mind, and Maria, finding herself unexpectedly
near to his cottage, determines to throw herself upon his forgiveness,
prevails upon an honest old servant to admit her to his presence,
supplicates for pardon, and is again received into his affections. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>reconciliation is not well brought about. Her seeking the interview
with her father through the connivance of a servant, after the repeated
rejection of every application to his tenderness, and when she has an
advocate in General Torrington, an old friend of Heartly’s, who
has undertaken to bring about a reconciliation, is not exceedingly
probable. After her clandestine introduction by the servant, the
reconciliation is first effected between Heartly and Maria, on the
supposition of her guilt, and is afterwards acted as it were twice over,
when the sight of a ring on her finger leads to the discovery of her
innocence. The comedy opens with the arrival of Maria at a
country inn, near Moreden-hall, kept by the widow Bustle. The
introductory scene between this veteran lady of the old school, and
her son Jack Bustle, who is infected with the modern cant of
humanity, and is besides very indecorous in his manners, is tediously
long. Maria’s depositing the hundred pounds in the hands of Mrs.
Bustle is a gratuitous improbability; and it is with some difficulty that
the notes are retrieved for the use of the right owner by the busy
interference of Mr. Jack Bustle and the generosity of Mr. Barney
O’Mulchesen, an honest Irishman, who at the beginning of the play
is the ostler, but at the end of it, as he himself informs us, becomes
‘the mistress of the Black Lion.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Johnstone gave great spirit, and an appearance of cordial good
humour, to this last character. He has a great deal of ‘the milk of
human kindness’ in all his acting. There is a rich genial suavity
of manner, a laughing confidence, a fine oily impudence about him,
which must operate as a saving grace to any character he is concerned
in, and would make it difficult to hiss him off the stage. In
any other hands we think Mr. Barney O’Mulchesen would have
stood some chance of being damned. Oxberry’s Tim was excellent:
in those kind of loose dangling characters, in which the limbs do not
seem to hang to the body nor the body to the mind, in which he has
to display meanness and poverty of spirit together with a natural love
of good fellowship and good cheer, there is nobody equal to Oxberry.
His scene with Dowton, his master, who comes home, and finds him
just returning from the fair, from the passionateness of the master and
the meekness of the man, had a very comic effect. This was the
best scene in the play, and the only one in it, which struck us as containing
any thing like originality in the conception of humour and
character. Of Mrs. Davison’s Lady Moreden, we cannot speak
favourably, if we are to speak what we think. Her acting is said to
have much playfulness about it; if so, it is <i>horse-play</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>A singularity in the construction of the scenes of this comedy is,
that they are nearly an uninterrupted series of tête-à-têtes: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>personages of the drama regularly come on in couples, and the two
persons go off the stage to make room for two others to come on, just
like the procession to Noah’s Ark. Perhaps this principle might be
improved upon, by making an entire play of nothing but soliloquies.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Covent-Garden.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Cymon, an opera, by Garrick, was brought out on Monday. It
is not very interesting, either in itself or the music. Mr. Duruset
played Cymon very naturally, though the compliment is, perhaps,
somewhat equivocal. Miss Stephens looked very prettily in Sylvia;
but the songs had not any great effect: ‘Sweet Passion of Love’ was
the best of them.</p>

physiognomy.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>December 10, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Miss O’Neill repeated her usual characters last week. We saw
her in Belvidera, and were disappointed. We do not think she plays
it so well as she did last year. We thought her representation of it
then as near perfection as possible; and her present acting we think
chargeable in many instances, with affectation and extravagance. She
goes into the two extremes of speaking so loud as to ‘split the ears
of the groundlings’ and so low as not to be heard. She has (or we
mistake) been taking a bad lesson of Mr. Kean: in our opinion, the
excellences of genius are not communicable. A second-rate actor
may learn of a first; but all imitation in the latter must prove a
source of error: for the power with which great talent works, can
only be regulated by its own suggestions and the force of nature.
The bodily energy which Mr. Kean exhibits cannot be transferred to
female characters, without making them disgusting instead of impressive.
Miss O’Neill during the two last acts of Belvidera, is in
a continual convulsion. But the intention of tragedy is to exhibit
mental passion and not bodily agony, or the last only as a necessary
concomitant of the former. Miss O’Neill clings so long about Jaffier,
and with such hysterical violence, before she leaps upon his neck and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>calls for the fatal blow, that the connection of the action with the
sentiment is lost in the pantomime exhibition before us. We are not
fastidious; nor do we object to having the painful worked up with
the catastrophe to the utmost pitch of human suffering; but we must
object to a constant recurrence of such extreme agony, as a convenient
common-place or trick to bring down thunders of applause. Miss
O’Neill twice, if we remember, seizes her forehead with her clenched
fists, making a hissing noise through her teeth, and twice is thrown
into a fit of agonized choking. Neither is her face fine enough in
itself not to become unpleasant by such extreme and repeated distortion.
Miss O’Neill’s freedom from mannerism was her great
charm, and we should be sorry to see her fall into it. Mr. C.
Kemble’s Jaffier had very considerable effect. Mr. Young’s Pierre
is his best character.</p>

<p class='c018'>A new Farce was brought out here on Monday week, the title of
which is What’s a Man of Fashion? a question which it does not
solve. A young lady (Miss Mathews) is left a fortune by her
father, on condition of her marrying a man of fashion within a year
of his death. Her aunt (Mrs. Davenport) is left her guardian, and
locks her up to prevent her marrying any one, that the fortune may
devolve to her. Old Project (personated by Fawcett) is instigated
by the young lady, through the key-hole of the door where she is
locked up, to find her a husband who shall also be a man of fashion;
and just as the old gentleman, who is a very strange mixture of the
sailor, fox-hunter, and Bond-street lounger, has undertaken this
laudable task, he meets his nephew (Mr. Jones), whom he fixes upon
as the candidate for the young lady and for fifty thousand pounds.
The whole business of the piece arises out of the attempts of Old
Project to bring them together, and the schemes of the aunt to
prevent the conclusion of the marriage before the expiration of the
year, that is, before it strikes twelve o’clock at night. After many
trifling and improbable adventures, Old Project and his nephew
succeed. The clock strikes twelve, but the man of fashion and his
mistress have been married a few minutes before, though nobody
knows how. We do not think this farce a bit better than some
we have lately noticed. The author seems to have sat down to
write it without a plot. There is neither dialogue nor character in
it, nor has it any thing to make it amusing, but the absurdity of the
incidents.</p>

<p class='c018'>We have seen Miss O’Neill in the Orphan, and almost repent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>what we have said above. Her Monimia is a piece of acting as
beautiful as it is affecting. We never wish to see it acted otherwise
or better. She is the Orphan that Otway drew.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘With pleas’d attention ‘midst his scenes we find</div>
      <div class='line'>Each glowing thought that warms the female mind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Each melting sigh and every tender tear,</div>
      <div class='line'>The lover’s wishes, and the virgin’s fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>His every strain the Smiles and Graces own.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This idea of the character, which never leaves the mind in reading
the play, was delightfully represented on the stage. Miss O’Neill
did not once overstep the limits of propriety, and was interesting in
every part. Her conversation with the page was delicately familiar
and playful. Her death was judiciously varied, and did not affect
the imagination less, because it gave no shock to the senses. Her
greatest effort, however, was in the scene with Polydore, where she
asks him, ‘Where did you rest last night?’ and where she falls
senseless on the floor at his answer. The breathless expectation, the
solemn injunction, the terror which the discovery strikes to her heart
as if she had been struck with lightning, had an irresistible effect.
Nothing could be pourtrayed with greater truth and feeling. We
liked Charles Kemble’s Castalio not much, and Mr. Conway’s
Polydore not at all. It is impossible that this gentleman should
become an actor, unless he could take ‘a cubit from his stature.’
Mr. Young’s Chamont was quite as good as the character deserves.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Kean’s appearance at Drury-Lane on Tuesday, in the Duke
Aranza, in the Honey Moon, excited considerable expectations in
the public. Our own were not fulfilled. We think this the least
brilliant of all his characters. It was Duke and no Duke. It had
severity without dignity; and was deficient in ease, grace, and gaiety.
He played the feigned character as if it were reality. Now we
believe that a spirit of raillery should be thrown over the part, so as
to carry off the gravity of the imposture. There is in Mr. Kean an
infinite variety of talent, with a certain monotony of genius. He has
not the same ease in doing common things that he has energy on great
occasions. We seldom entirely lose sight of his Richard, and to a
certain degree, in all his acting, ‘<i>he still plays the dog</i>.’ His dancing
was encored. George <span class='fss'>II.</span> encored Garrick in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Minuet de la
Cour</span></cite>: Mr. Kean’s was not like court dancing. It had more
alacrity than ease.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>December 17, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Merchant of Bruges; or, The Beggars’ Bush, altered from
Beaumont and Fletcher, was brought out at Drury-Lane on Thursday,
with great preparation, applause, and effect. Contrary, we believe,
to Green-room expectation, it answered completely. This, assuredly,
is not a classical drama; but the spirit of poetry constantly peeps out
from beneath the rags, and patches, and miserable disguise, in which
it is clothed. Where the eye was most offended by the want of
costume, songs and music came to its relief. The airs selected by
Mr. T. Cooke were admirably adapted to the situations, and we need
not remind the critical reader, that the lyrical effusions in Beaumont
and Fletcher are master-pieces in their kind. They are exactly
fitted to be either ‘said or sung’ under the green-wood tree. One or
two of these were sung separately, with a good deal of sweetness and
characteristic <i>naiveté</i>, by Miss L. Kelly, who is one of the supposed
beggars, but a princess in disguise. Either we mistook certain
significant intimations, or she wished to make this appear before the
proper time. One of the oddest transformations in the Beggars’
Bush, was, that it inspired Mr. Holland with no small degree of
animation and fancy; for he depicted the worthy Clause, who is
at the same time the King of the Beggars, the Father of the
Merchant of Bruges, and the old Earl of Flanders, inimitably
well.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, Mr. Oxberry and Harley were most respectable Beggars,
and had their cues perfect (which was more than Mr. Pope had in
the prologue); Mr. Kean topped his part as the Merchant-Earl,
Mr. Munden was not far behind him as the drunken Burgo-master,
and Mr. S. Penley, Mr. Rae, and Mr. Raymond, served to fill the
stage. The scenes from which this play derived its interest, and
which both for sentiment and situation were admirable, are those in
which Mr. Kean vindicates his character as a Merchant and his love
for Gertrude against the arrogant assumptions of her uncle
(Raymond), and disarms the latter in the fight. His retort upon
the noble baron, who accuses him of being a barterer of pepper and
sugar, ‘that every petty lord lived upon his rents or the sale of his
beves, his poultry, his milk and his butter,’ made a forcible appeal to
John Bull, nor did the manner in which Munden, who is bottle-holder
on the occasion, vociferated, ‘Don’t forget butter,’ take away
from the effect. The whole of this scene is (if not in the best) in
the most peculiar and striking manner of Beaumont and Fletcher. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>is the very petulance of youthful ardour and aspiring self-opinion,
defying and taunting the frigid prejudices of age and custom. If
Mr. Kean’s voice failed him, his expression and his action did full
justice to the heroic spirit and magnanimity of conception of the poet,
where he says to his mistress, after depriving his antagonist of his
sword, ‘Within these arms thou art safe as in a wall of brass,’ and
again, folding her to his breast, exclaims, ‘Come, kiss me, love,’ and
afterwards rising in his extravagant importunity, ‘Come, say before
all these, say that thou lov’st me.’ We do not think any of the
German dramatic paradoxes come up to this in spirit, and in acting
as it were up to the feeling of the moment, irritated by a triumph
over long-established and insolent pretension. The scene between
Mr. Kean and Gertrude (Mrs. Horn), where he is in a manner distracted
between his losses and his love, had great force and feeling.
We have seen him do much the same thing before. There is a very
fine pulsation in the veins of his forehead on these occasions, an
expression of nature which we do not remember in any other actor.
One of the last scenes, in which <i>Clause</i> brings in the money-bags to
the creditors, and Kean bends forward pointing to them, and Munden
after him, repeating the same attitude, but caricaturing it, was a
perfect <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-théatre</span></i>. The last scene rather disappointed our expectations;
but the whole together went off admirably, and every one
went away satisfied.</p>

<p class='c014'>The story of the Merchant of Bruges is founded on the usurped
authority of Woolmar, as Earl of Flanders, to the exclusion of
Gerald, the rightful heir, and his infant son Floris; the latter of
whom, on his father being driven out by the usurper, has been placed
with a rich merchant of Bruges; whilst the father, with his infant
daughter, takes refuge among a band of Beggars, whose principal
resort is in a wood near the town of Bruges. Young Floris is
brought up by the merchant as his own son; and on the death of his
protector, whom he considers as his real father, succeeds to his
property, and becomes the principal merchant in Bruges. Gerald, in
the mean time, is elected King of the Beggars; and, by the influence
which his authority gives him over the fraternity, he is enabled to
assist his son with a large sum of money at a time when he is on the
verge of bankruptcy, owing to the non-arrival of several vessels richly
laden, and which are detained by contrary winds. This circumstance
gives the supposed Beggar considerable influence over the actions of
his son, who declares himself ready to pay him the duties of a son,
without being at all suspicious that it is indeed his real parent whom
he is thus obeying; and Gerald, determining to reveal to his son the
mystery of his birth, appoints an interview with him at midnight, near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>the Beggar’s Bush, in the Forest. In the mean time Woolmar,
having learnt that Gerald and Floris, whom he supposes dead, are
still living, and that Gerald is concealed amongst the Beggars, goes
with a troop of horse at midnight to the Beggar’s Bush, for the
purpose of surprising him. His plan is, however, circumvented by
Hubert, a nobleman at the court of Woolmar, but who is secretly
attached to the right heir. Hubert conveys intelligence of the
intended attempt of Woolmar to Gerald, and a strong band of the
Beggars are armed, and set in readiness to seize him on his entering
a particular part of the forest, to which he is enticed by Hubert,
under pretence of leading him to the spot where Gerald is concealed.
Here they arrive just at the time Floris, by appointment, meets his
father Gerald. Woolmar falls into the trap prepared for him, and
is, with his principal confidant, Hemskirk, secured. An explanation
takes place, and Gerald resigning his pretensions to his son,
Floris, the Merchant is restored to the possession of the earldom
of Flanders, and Woolmar, the usurping Earl, is banished for life.</p>

<p class='c014'>A new piece in five acts, called Smiles and Tears; or the
Widow’s Stratagem, has been produced, with very considerable
success, at Covent-Garden Theatre. The Dramatis Personæ are:</p>

<p class='c014'>The plot is as follows: Lady Emily, a young widow supposed to
possess every amiable quality of body and mind, has for her intimate
friend Mrs. Belmore, who is also a widow, and engaged in a law-suit
with Sir Henry Chomley, by which she is likely to lose her whole
fortune. Sir Henry has by chance met Lady Emily at a masquerade,
where he has become deeply enamoured of her figure, wit, and
vivacity, without having ever seen her face; and having at length
obtained information who she is, and where she resides, writes to her,
soliciting an interview, and declaring the impression which her person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and conversation had made on his heart. Lady Emily being herself
sincerely attached to Colonel O’Donolan, determines to convert the
passion of Sir Henry to the advantage of her friend Mrs. Belmore;
and as they have never seen each other, to introduce Mrs. Belmore
to Sir Henry as Lady Emily: but, aware that Mrs. Belmore will
not receive Sir Henry’s addresses, whom she regards as her enemy,
on account of the law-suit between them, she writes to Sir Henry
that she will admit his visits, but that it must, for particular reasons,
be under the assumed name of Grenville; and as Mr. Grenville, she
prevails on Mrs. Belmore to receive him in the name of Lady Emily,
assigning as her reason for this request, her fear of seeing him herself,
lest the Colonel’s jealousy should be excited. Several interviews
take place between Sir Henry and Mrs. Belmore, who conceive so
warm an attachment for each other, under their assumed characters,
that when the widow’s stratagem is discovered, they gladly agree to
put an end to their law-suit by a matrimonial union. The other, and
the most afflicting part of the plot, turns on a stratagem conceived by
Lady Emily (who it must be allowed is fruitful in stratagems), to
restore Fitzharding to his reason, and his daughter to his affections,
both of which had been lost by the dishonourable conduct of Delaval,
who had first seduced, and then deserted the lovely and unsuspecting
Cicely Fitzharding.</p>

<p class='c014'>All that is particularly good in this play arises from the mistakes
and surprises produced by the double confusion of the names of the
principal characters concerned in the Widow’s Stratagem. The
scene between Charles Kemble and Jones, when the former acquaints
him with his success with the supposed Lady Emily, and in which
Jones testifies a resentment against his rival as violent as it is in reality
groundless, was in the true spirit of comedy. Jones’s scene with the
Widow Belmore (Mrs. Faucit), in which the mystery is cleared up
to him, is also conceived and executed with great spirit and effect.
The character which Jones represents, an Irish Colonel, is one of the
most misplaced and absurd we remember to have seen, and the only
excuse for whose blunders, rudeness, officiousness, and want of common
sense, is (as far as we could learn), that he is a countryman of Lord
Wellington. This is but an indifferent compliment to his Grace,
and perhaps no great one to Colonel O’Donolan. There were two
direct clap-traps aimed directly at the Duke’s popularity, which did
not take. The truth, we suspect, is, that his Lordship is not very
popular at present in either of his two great characters, as liberator of
Ferdinand <span class='fss'>VII.</span> or as keeper of Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> Charles Kemble played
the part of Sir Henry Chomley with that gentlemanly ease, gaiety,
and good nature, which always gain him the entire favour of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>audience in such characters. He indeed did as much for this play
as if it had been his own. Mrs. Faucit played Mrs. Belmore
exceedingly well. There was something that reminded us of a
jointure and a view to a second match in her whole look and air. We
cannot speak a word of praise of Mrs. C. Kemble’s Lady Emily.
Neither her person nor her manner at all suited the character, nor the
description of it which is several times interlarded in the dialogue.
Her walk is not the fine lady; she is nearly the worst actress we
ever saw in the artificial <i>mimmine-pimmine</i> style of Miss Farren. We
hope she will discontinue such characters, and return to nature; or
she will make us forget her Lucy Lockitt, or what we should hope
never to forget, her acting in Julio in Deaf and Dumb.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a great deal of affectation of gentility, and a great deal of
real indecorum, in the comic dialogue of this play. The tragic part
is violent and vulgar in the extreme. Mr. Young is brought forward
as a downright common madman, just broke loose from a madhouse
at Richmond, and is going with a club to dash out the brains of his
daughter, Miss Foote, and her infant. This infant is no other than
a large wooden doll: it fell on the floor the other evening without
receiving any hurt, at which the audience laughed. This dreadful
interlude is taken, we suppose, from Mrs. Opie’s tale of Father and
Daughter, of which we thought never to have heard or seen any thing
more. As the whole of this part is conceived without the smallest
poetical feeling, so Mr. Young did not contrive to throw one ray of
genius over it. Miss Foote behaved throughout very prettily,
dutifully and penitently; and in the last scene, where, to bring
back her father’s senses, she is made to stand in a frame and to
represent her own portrait playing on the harp, she looked a
perfect picture.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>GEORGE BARNWELL</h3>

<div class='lg-container-l c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'><cite>The Examiner.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>December 31, 1815.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>George Barnwell has been acted as usual at both Theatres during
the Christmas week. Whether this is ‘a custom more honoured in
the breach or the observance,’ we shall not undertake to decide. But
there is one error on this subject which we wish to correct; which
is, that its defects arise from its being too natural. It is one of the
most improbable and purely arbitrary fictions we have ever seen.
Lillo is by some people considered as a kind of natural Shakespear,
and Shakespear as a poetical Lillo. We look upon Shakespear to
have been a greater man than the Ordinary of Newgate; and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>at the same time conceive that there is not any one of the stories in
the Newgate Calendar so badly told as this tragedy of Lillo’s. Lillo
seems to have proceeded on the old Scotch proverb,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The kirk is gude, and the gallows is gude.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>He comes with his moral lessons and his terrible examples; a sermon
in the morning and an execution at night; the tolling of the bell for
Tyburn follows hard upon the bell that knolls to church. Nothing
can be more virtuous or prudent than George Barnwell at the end of
the first act, or a more consummate rogue and fool than he is at the
beginning of the second. This play is a piece of wretched cant; it
is an insult on the virtues and the vices of human nature; it supposes
that the former are relinquished and the others adopted without
common sense or reason, for the sake of a Christmas catastrophe, of
a methodistical moral. The account of a young unsuspecting man
being seduced by the allurements of an artful prostitute is natural
enough, and something might have been built on this foundation, but
all the rest is absurd, and equally senseless as poetry or prose. It is
a caricature on the imbecility of goodness, and of the unprovoked and
gratuitous depravity of vice. Shakespear made ‘these odds more
even;’ that is, he drew from nature, and did not drag the theatre
into the service of the conventicle. George Barnwell first robs his
master at Milwood’s instigation: (this lady has the merit of being
what Dr. Johnson would have called ‘a good hater’). He then,
being in want of money, proceeds to rob and murder somebody; and
in the way of deliberation and selection fixes upon his uncle, his
greatest friend and benefactor, as if he were the only man in the
world who carried a purse. He therefore goes to seek him in his
solitary walks, where, good man, he is reading a book on the shortness
and uncertainty of human life, bursting out, as he reads, into
suitable comments, which, as his ungracious nephew, who watches
behind him in crape, says, shews that ‘he is the fitter for heaven.’
Well, he turns round, and sees that he is way-laid by some one; but
his nephew, at the sight of his benign and well-known aspect, drops the
pistol, but presently after stabs him to the heart. This is no sooner
effected without remorse or pity, but the instant it is over, he loses
all thought of the purpose which had instigated him to the act, the
securing his property (not that it appears he had any about him), and
this raw, desperate convert to vice returns to his mistress, to say that
he had committed the murder, and omitted the robbery. On being
questioned as to the <i>proceeds</i> of so nefarious a business, our retrospective
enthusiast asks, ‘Could he lay sacrilegious hands on the body
he had just murdered?’ to which his cooler and more rational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>accomplice replies, ‘That as he had robbed him of his life, which
was no doubt precious to him, she did not see why he should not
rifle his pockets of that which, being dead, could be of no farther use
to him.’ However, Barnwell makes such a noise with his virtue and
his penitence, that she is alarmed for the consequences; and anticipating
a discovery of the whole, calls in the constable, and gives up
her companion as a measure of precaution. Her maid, however,
who is her confidante, has been before-hand with her, and she is
also taken into custody, and both are hanged. Such is the morality
of this piece.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE BUSY BODY</h3>

<div class='lg-container-l c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>January 7, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The admirable Comedy of the Busy Body was brought out at
Drury-Lane Theatre on Wednesday, for the purpose of introducing
Mrs. Mardyn in Miranda. She acted the part very delightfully, and
without at all overdoing it. We seem to regret her former luxuriance
of manner, and think she might take greater liberties with the public,
without offence. Though she has lost some of the heyday vivacity
of her natural spirits, she looks as charmingly as ever.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Dowton’s Gripe was not one of his best performances. It is
very much a character of grimace, and Munden perhaps would do it
better on this account, for he is the greatest caricaturist on the stage.
It was the character in which he originally appeared. We never saw
him in it, but in several parts we missed his broad shining face, the
orbicular rolling of his eye, and the alarming drop of his chin. Mr.
Dowton, however, gave the whining tones and the dotage of fondness
very well, and ‘his voice pipes and whistles in the sound, like second
childishness.’ If any thing, he goes too far in this, and drawls out
his ecstasies too much into the tabernacle sing-song.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Harley played Marplot in a very lively and amusing manner.
He presented a very laughable picture of blundering vivacity and
blank stupidity. This gentleman is the most <i>moveable</i> actor on the
stage. He runs faster and stops shorter than any body else. There
was but one fault in his delineation of the character. The officious
Marplot is a gentleman, a foolish one, to be sure; but Harley played
it like a footman. We observed also, that when Mr. Harley got
very deserved applause by his manner of strutting, and sidling, and
twisting himself about in the last scene, where he fights, he continued
to repeat the same gestures over again, as if he had been <i>encored</i> by
the audience.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>We cannot close these remarks, without expressing the satisfaction
which we received from this play. It is not so profound in wit or
character as some other of the old Comedies, but it is nothing but
bustle and gaiety from beginning to end. The plot never ceases.
The ingenuity of contrivance is admirable. The developement of
the story is an uninterrupted series of what the French call <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups
de théatre</span></i>, and the situations succeed one another like the changes of
machinery in a pantomime. It is a true comic pantomime.</p>

<p class='c018'>A lady of the name of Barnes has appeared in Desdemona at
this Theatre. Her voice is powerful, her face is pretty, but her
person is too <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</span></i> and undignified for tragedy. Her conception
of the part was good, and she gave to some of the scenes considerable
feeling and effect; but who shall represent ‘the divine
Desdemona?’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean’s Othello is his best character, and the highest effort of
genius on the stage. We say this without any exception or reserve.
Yet we wish it was better than it is. In parts, we think he rises as
high as human genius can go: at other times, though powerful, the
whole effort is thrown away in a wrong direction, and disturbs our
idea of the character. There are some technical objections. Othello
was tall; but that is nothing: he was black, but that is nothing.
But he was not fierce, and that is every thing. It is only in the last
agony of human suffering that he gives way to his rage and his
despair, and it is in working his noble nature up to that extremity,
that Shakespear has shewn his genius and his vast power over the
human heart. It was in raising passion to its height, from the lowest
beginnings and in spite of all obstacles, in shewing the conflict of the
soul, the tug and war between love and hatred, rage, tenderness,
jealousy, remorse, in laying open the strength and the weaknesses of
human nature, in uniting sublimity of thought with the anguish of the
keenest woe, in putting in motion all the springs and impulses which
make up this our mortal being, and at last blending them in that
noble tide of deep and sustained passion, impetuous, but majestic,
‘that flows on to the Propontic and knows no ebb,’ that the great
excellence of Shakespear lay. Mr. Kean is in general all passion,
all energy, all relentless will. He wants imagination, that faculty
which contemplates events, and broods over feelings with a certain
calmness and grandeur; his feelings almost always hurry on to action,
and hardly ever repose upon themselves. He is too often in the
highest key of passion, too uniformly on the verge of extravagance,
too constantly on the rack. This does very well in certain characters,
as Zanga or Bajazet, where there is merely a physical passion, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>boiling of the blood to be expressed, but it is not so in the lofty-minded
and generous Moor.</p>

<p class='c014'>We make these remarks the more freely, because there were parts
of the character in which Mr. Kean shewed the greatest sublimity
and pathos, by laying aside all violence of action. For instance, the
tone of voice in which he delivered the beautiful apostrophe, ‘Then,
oh, farewell!’ struck on the heart like the swelling notes of some
divine music, like the sound of years of departed happiness. Why
not all so, or all that is like it? why not speak the affecting passage—‘I
found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips’—why not speak the last
speech, in the same manner? They are both of them, we do most
strenuously contend, speeches of pure pathos, of thought, and feeling,
and not of passion, venting itself in violence of action or gesture.
Again, the look, the action, the expression of voice, with which he
accompanied the exclamation, ‘Not a jot, not a jot,’ was perfectly
heart-rending. His vow of revenge against Cassio, and his abandonment
of his love for Desdemona, were as fine as possible. The
whole of the third act had an irresistible effect upon the house, and
indeed is only to be paralleled by the murder scene in Macbeth.
Mr. Pope’s Iago was better acted than usual, but he does not look
the character. Mr. Holland’s drunken scene was, as it always is,
excellent.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS</h3>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>January 14, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Massinger’s play of A New Way to Pay Old Debts, which has
been brought out at Drury-Lane Theatre to introduce Mr. Kean in
the part of Sir Giles Overreach, must have afforded a rich treat
to theatrical amateurs. There is something in a good play well
acted, a peculiar charm, that makes us forget ourselves and all the
world.</p>

<p class='c014'>It has been considered as the misfortune of great talents for the
stage, that they leave no record behind them, except that of vague
rumour, and that the genius of a great actor perishes with him,
‘leaving the world no copy.’ This is a misfortune, or at least a
mortifying reflection, to actors; but it is, we conceive, an advantage
to the stage. It leaves an opening to originality. The stage is
always beginning anew; the candidates for theatrical reputation are
always setting out afresh, unencumbered by the affectation of the faults
or excellences of their predecessors. In this respect, we conceive
that the average quantity of dramatic talent remains more nearly the
same than that in any other walk of art. In the other arts, (as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>painting and poetry), it may be supposed that what has been well
done already, by giving rise to endless vapid imitations, is an obstacle
to what might be done hereafter: that the models or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvres</span></i> of
art, where they are accumulated, choke up the path to excellence;
and that the works of genius, where they can be rendered permanent,
and transmitted from age to age, not only prevent, but render
superfluous, future productions of the same kind. We have not,
neither do we want, two Shakespears, two Miltons, two Raphaels,
two Popes, any more than we require two suns in the same sphere.
Even Miss O’Neill stands a little in the way (and it is paying her a
great compliment to say so) of our recollections of Mrs. Siddons.
But Mr. Kean is an excellent substitute for the memory of Garrick,
whom we never saw! When an author dies, it is no matter, for his
works remain. When a great actor dies, there is a void produced
in society, a gap which requires to be filled up. Who does not
go to see Kean? Who, if Garrick were alive, would go to see him?
At least, either one or the other must have quitted the stage; ‘For
two at a time there’s no mortal could bear.’ Again, we know that
Mr. Kean cannot have been spoiled by Garrick. He might indeed
have been spoiled by Mr. Kemble or Mr. Cooke, but he fortunately
has not. The stage is a place where genius is sure to come upon its
legs in a generation or two. We cannot conceive of better actors
than some of those we now have. In Comedy, Liston is as good as
Edwin was when we were school-boys. We grant that we are
deficient in genteel comedy; we have no fine gentlemen or ladies
on the stage—nor off it. That which is merely artificial and local
is a matter of mimicry, and must exist, to be well copied. Players,
however, have little reason to complain of their hard-earned, short-lived
popularity. One thunder of applause from pit, boxes, and
galleries, is equal to a whole immortality of posthumous fame; and
when we hear an actor whose modesty is equal to his merit, declare
that he would like to see a dog wag his tail in approbation, what
must he feel when he sets the whole house in a roar? Besides, Fame,
as if their reputation had been entrusted to her alone, has been particularly
careful of the renown of her theatrical favourites; she forgets
one by one, and year by year, those who have been great lawyers,
great statesmen, and great warriors in their day; but the name of
Garrick still survives, with the works of Reynolds and of Johnson.</p>

<p class='c014'>We do not know any one now-a-days, who could write Massinger’s
Comedy of A New Way to Pay Old Debts, though we do not
believe that it was better acted at the time it was first brought out,
than it is at present. We cannot conceive of any one’s doing Mr.
Kean’s part of Sir Giles Overreach so well as himself. We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>seen others in the part, superior in the look and costume, in hardened,
clownish, rustic insensibility; but in the soul and spirit, no one equal
to him. He is a truly great actor. This is one of his very best
parts. He was not at a single fault. The passages which we
remarked as particularly striking and original, were those where he
expresses his surprise at his nephew’s answers, ‘His fortune swells
him!—’Tis rank, he’s married!’ and again, where, after the
exposure of his villanies, he calls to his accomplice Marall in a half-wheedling,
half-terrific tone, ‘Come hither Marall, come hither.’
Though the speech itself is absurd and out of character, his manner
of stopping when he is running at his foes, ‘I’m feeble, some widow’s
curse hangs on my sword,’ was exactly as if his arm had been
suddenly withered, and his powers shrivelled up on the instant. The
conclusion was quite overwhelming. Mr. Kean looked the part
well, and his voice does not fail as it used to do. Mr. Munden’s
Marall was an admirable piece of acting, and produced some of the
most complete comic contrasts we ever saw. He overdoes his parts
sometimes, and sometimes gets into parts for which he is not fit: but
he has a fine broad face and manner which tells all the world over.
His manner of avoiding the honour of a salute from the Lady
Allworth, was a most deliberate piece of humour; and the account of
the unexpected good fortune of young Welborn almost converts his
eyes into saucers, and chokes him with surprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Oxberry’s Justice Greedy was very entertaining, both from
the subject and from his manner of doing it. Oxberry is a man of
a practical imagination, and the apparitions of fat turkeys, chines of
bacon, and pheasants dressed in toast and butter, evidently floated in
rapturous confusion before his senses. There is nothing that goes
down better than what relates to eating and drinking, on the stage, in
books, or in real life. Mr. Harley’s Welborn was indifferent, but
he is upon the whole a very pleasant actor. Mrs. Glover, as Lady
Allworth, puts on some very agreeable frowns; and Mr. Holland’s
Lord Lovell was one continued smile, without any meaning that we
could discover, unless this actor, after his disguise in the Beggar’s
Bush, was delighted with the restoration of his hat and feather.</p>

<p class='c014'>We hope we have not been accessory to murder, in recommending
a delightful poem to be converted into a dull pantomime; for such is
the fate of the Midsummer Night’s Dream. We have found to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>cost, once for all, that the regions of fancy and the boards of Covent-Garden
are not the same thing. All that is fine in the play, was
lost in the representation. The spirit was evaporated, the genius was
fled; but the spectacle was fine: it was that which saved the play. Oh,
ye scene-shifters, ye scene-painters, ye machinists and dressmakers,
ye manufacturers of moon and stars that give no light, ye
musical composers, ye men in the orchestra, fiddlers and trumpeters

Matthews, Carew, Burrell, and Mac Alpine, we shall remember you:

Flute the bellows-mender, Snug the joiner, Starveling the tailor,

Bottom, thou valiant Bottom, what shall we say to thee? Thou
didst console us much; thou didst perform a good part well; thou
didst top the part of Bottom the weaver! He comes out of thy

of exquisite whim and humour; and thou didst hector over thy
companions well, and fall down flat before the Duke, like other
bullies, well; and thou didst sing the song of the Black Ousel
well; but chief, thou didst noddle thy ass’s head, which had
been put upon thee, well; and didst seem to say, significantly,

<p class='c014'>All that was good in this piece (except the scenery) was Mr.
Liston’s Bottom, which was an admirable and judicious piece of
acting. Mr. Conway was Theseus. Who would ever have taken
this gentleman for the friend and companion of Hercules? Miss
Stephens played the part of Hermia, and sang several songs very
delightfully, which however by no means assisted the progress or
interest of the story. Miss Foote played Helena. She is a very
sweet girl, and not at all a bad actress; yet did any one feel or even
hear her address to Hermia? To shew how far asunder the closet

      <div class='line'>All school days’ friendship, childhood innocence?</div>
      <div class='line'>We, Hermia, like two artificial Gods,</div>

<p class='c014'>In turning to Shakespear to look for this passage, the book opened
at the Midsummer Night’s Dream, the title of which half gave us
back our old feeling; and in reading this one speech twice over, we
have completely forgot all the noise we have heard and the sights we
have seen. Poetry and the stage do not agree together. The
attempt to reconcile them fails not only of effect, but of decorum.
The <i>ideal</i> has no place upon the stage, which is a picture without
perspective; every thing there is in the foreground. That which is
merely an airy shape, a dream, a passing thought, immediately
becomes an unmanageable reality. Where all is left to the imagination,
every circumstance has an equal chance of being kept in mind,
and tells according to the mixed impression of all that has been
suggested. But the imagination cannot sufficiently qualify the
impressions of the senses. Any offence given to the eye is not to be
got rid of by explanation. Thus Bottom’s head in the play is a
fantastic illusion, produced by magic spells: on the stage it is an ass’s
head, and nothing more; certainly a very strange costume for a
gentleman to appear in. Fancy cannot be represented any more than
a simile can be painted; and it is as idle to attempt it as to personate
Wall or Moonshine. Fairies are not incredible, but fairies six feet
high are so. Monsters are not shocking, if they are seen at a proper
distance. When ghosts appear in mid-day, when apparitions stalk
along Cheapside, then may the Midsummer Night’s Dream be
represented at Covent-Garden or at Drury-Lane; for we hear, that
it is to be brought out there also, and that we have to undergo another
crucifixion.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Faucit played the part of Titania very well, but for one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>circumstance—that she is a woman. The only glimpse which we
caught of the possibility of acting the imaginary scenes properly, was
from the little girl who dances before the fairies (we do not know
her name), which seemed to shew that the whole might be carried
off in the same manner—by a miracle.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>Drury-Lane.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The admirable comedy of a New Way to Pay Old Debts, continues
to be acted with increased effect. Mr. Kean is received with shouts
of applause in Sir Giles Overreach. We have heard two objections
to his manner of doing this part, one of which we think right and the
other not. When he is asked, ‘Is he not moved by the orphan’s
tears, the widow’s curse?’ he answers—‘Yes—as rocks by waves,
or the moon by howling wolves.’ Mr. Kean, in speaking the latter
sentence, dashes his voice about with the greatest violence, and howls
out his indignation and rage. Now we conceive this is wrong: for
he has to express not violence, but firm, inflexible resistance to it,—not
motion, but rest. The very pause after the word <i>yes</i>, points out
the cool deliberate way in which it should be spoken. The other
objection is to his manner of pronouncing the word ‘Lord,—Right
Honourable Lord,’ which Mr. Kean uniformly does in a drawling
tone, with a mixture of fawning servility and sarcastic contempt.
This has been thought inconsistent with the part, and with the desire
which Sir Giles has to ennoble his family by alliance with a ‘Lord,
a Right Honourable Lord.’ We think Mr. Kean never shewed
more genius than in pronouncing this single word, <i>Lord</i>. It is a
complete exposure (produced by the violence of the character), of
the elementary feelings which make up the common respect excited
by mere rank. This is nothing but a cringing to power and opinion,
with a view to turn them to our own advantage with the world.
Sir Giles is one of those knaves, who ‘do themselves homage.’ He
makes use of Lord Lovell merely as the stalking-horse of his
ambition. In other respects, he has the greatest contempt for him,
and the necessity he is under of paying court to him for his own
purposes, infuses a double portion of gall and bitterness into the
expression of his self-conscious superiority. No; Mr. Kean was
perfectly right in this, he spoke the word ‘Lord’ <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>. His
praise of the kiss, ‘It came twanging off—I like it,’ was one of his
happiest passages. It would perhaps be as well, if in the concluding
scene he would contrive not to frighten the ladies into hysterics.
But the whole together is admirable.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>January 28, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Congreve’s Comedy of Love for Love is, in wit and elegance,
perhaps inferior to the Way of the World; but it is unquestionably
the best-acting of all his plays. It abounds in dramatic situation, in
incident, in variety of character. Still (such is the power of good
writing) we prefer reading it in the closet, to seeing it on the stage.
As it was acted the other night at Drury-Lane Theatre, many of the
finest traits of character were lost. Though Love for Love is much
less a tissue of epigrams than his other plays, the author has not been
able to keep his wit completely under. Jeremy is almost as witty
and learned as his master.—The part which had the greatest effect in
the acting was Munden’s Foresight. We hardly ever saw a richer
or more powerful piece of comic acting. It was done to the life,
and indeed somewhat over; but the effect was irresistible. His
look was planet-struck, his dress and appearance like one of the signs
of the Zodiac taken down. We never saw any thing more bewildered.
Parsons, if we remember right, gave more imbecility, more of the
doating garrulity of age, to the part, and blundered on with a less determined
air of stupidity.—Mr. Dowton did not make much of Sir
Sampson Legend. He looked well, like a hale, hearty old gentleman,
with a close bob-wig, and bronze complexion;—but that was all. We
were very much amused with Mr. Harley’s <i>Tattle</i>. His indifference in
the scene where he breaks off his engagement with Miss Prue, was
very entertaining. In the scene in which he teaches her how to
make love, he was less successful: he delivered his lessons to his fair
disciple with the air of a person giving good advice, and did not seem
to have a proper sense of his good fortune. ‘Desire to please, and
you will infallibly please,’ is an old maxim, and Mr. Harley is an
instance of the truth of it. This actor is always in the best possible
humour with himself and the audience. He is as happy as if he had
jumped into the very part which he liked the best of all others. Mr.
Rae, on the contrary, who played Valentine, apparently feels as little
satisfaction as he communicates. He always acts with an air of
injured excellence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Mardyn’s Miss Prue was not one of her most successful
characters. It was a little hard and coarse. It was not fond and
yielding enough. Miss Prue is made of the most susceptible
materials. She played the hoydening parts best, as where she cries
out, ‘School’s up, school’s up!’—and she knocked off Mr. Bartley’s
hat with great good-will.—Mr. Bartley was Ben; and we confess we
think Miss Prue’s distaste to him very natural. We cannot make up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>our minds to like this actor; and yet we have no fault to find with
him. For instance, he played the character of Ben very properly;
that is, just like ‘a great sea-porpoise.’ There is an art of qualifying
such a part in a manner to carry off its disagreeableness, which Mr.
Bartley wants.—Mrs. Harlowe’s Mrs. Frail was excellent: she
appeared to be the identical Mrs. Frail, with all her airs of mincing
affectation, and want of principle. The character was seen quite in
dishabille. The scene between her and her sister Mrs. Foresight,
about the discovery of the pin—‘And pray sister where did you find
that pin?’—was managed with as much coolness as any thing of this
sort that ever happened in real life.—Mrs. Orger played Mrs. Foresight
with much ease and natural propriety. She in general reposes
too much on her person, and does not display all the animation of
which the character is susceptible. She is also too much in female
parts, what the <i>walking fine gentleman</i> of the stage used to be in male.
Mr. Barnard played Jeremy with a smart shrug in his shoulders, and
the trusty air of a valet in his situation.</p>

<p class='c014'>The well known collection of French trials, under the title of
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Causes Celebres</span></cite>, has served as the ground-work of a new piece,
brought out on Thursday at Drury-Lane Theatre, called Accusation,
or The Anglade Family. The old historical materials are rather
scanty, consisting only of a narrative of a robbery committed on a
nobleman by some members of his own household, for which a
M. D’Anglade, who with his family occupied part of the same hotel,
was condemned on false evidence to the gallies, where grief and
mortification put a period to his life before his innocence was
discovered. On this foundation an interesting drama has been raised
by the French author. M. Valmore is introduced as a lover of
Madame D’Anglade, who rejects his unlawful passion. In revenge,
he agrees with a worthless valet to rob his aunt, who resides under
the same roof with the family of M. D’Anglade, in whose hands
part of the stolen property (consisting of bank-notes—a trifling
anachronism) is treacherously deposited by an accomplice of Hubert,
Valmore’s servant, under pretence of paying for jewels which
D’Anglade is compelled to dispose of to satisfy the demands made
upon him by a relation who was supposed to have been dead, and
whose estate he had inherited. He is seized under strong circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>of suspicion by the police, and conveyed to prison; but the
agents of Valmore are detected in stealing away with part of the
property from the place where it had been secreted: they are stopped
separately by the domestics of the injured person—each is made to
believe that his accomplice has betrayed him—and on the manifestation
of D’Anglade’s innocence and of his own guilt, Valmore, unable
to escape the pursuit of the officers of justice, puts an end to his
existence with a pistol, in a summer-house in which he has in vain
tried to conceal himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>The interest excited is much of the same kind as in the Maid and
the Magpye: and we think the piece will be almost as great a
favourite with the public. There is a great deal of ingenuity shewn
in the developement of the plot; the scenic effect is often beautiful,
and the situations have real pathos.</p>

<p class='c014'>The acting was upon the whole excellent. Miss Kelly, as the
wife of the unfortunate D’Anglade, gave a high degree of interest to
the story. She was only less delightful in this character than in that
of the Maid of Paliseau, because she has less to do in it. Mr. Rae
was the hero of the present drama, and he acquitted himself in it
with considerable applause. We never saw Mr. Bartley to so much
advantage as in the rough, honest character of the relation of
D’Anglade, (we forget the name), who comes to claim restitution of
his fortune, to try the integrity of his old friend, but who generously
offers him his assistance as soon as he finds him plunged in distress.
Mr. Wallack was Valmore, and there was a scene of really fine
acting between him and Mrs. Glover, (the Countess of Servan, his
aunt), where she tries to probe the guilty conscience of her nephew,
and to induce him to release D’Anglade from his dangerous situation,
by a confession of the treachery of which he has been made the
victim. Mr. S. Penley played the part of the unprincipled valet
very unexceptionably, and Mr. Barnard made an admirable accomplice,
in the character of a strolling Italian musician. Knight, as the raw
country lad by whose means the plot is chiefly discovered, was as
natural as he always is in such characters. He perhaps has got too
much of a habit of expressing his joy by running up and down the
stage with his arms spread out like a pair of wings. Mr. Powell, as
the faithful old servant of the Anglade family, was highly respectable.
One sentiment in the play, ‘The woman who follows her husband to
a prison, to share or to alleviate his misfortunes, is an ornament to
her sex, and an honour to human nature,’ was highly applauded—we
do not know for what particular reason.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c015'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<div class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span><i>Covent-Garden.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The same drama has been abridged and brought out here as an
After-piece. We cannot speak highly of the alteration. The sentimental
French romance is cut down into an English farce, in which
both the interest of the story and the <i>naiveté</i> of the characters are lost.
The two characters of the Valet and the Italian stroller are confounded
in the same person, and played by Mathews, who is death to the
pathetic! Charles Kemble played the Count D’Anglade in a very
gentlemanly manner. Farley was the most turbulent Valet we have
ever seen.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>February 11, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>In the ‘Lectures on Dramatic Literature by William Schlegel,’
the German translator of Shakespear, is the following criticism on
Measure for Measure, which has been just acted at Covent-Garden
Theatre: ‘In Measure for Measure, Shakespear was compelled, by
the nature of the subject, to make his poetry more familiar with
criminal justice than is usual with him. All kinds of proceedings
connected with the subject, all sorts of active or passive persons, pass
in review before us; the hypocritical Lord Deputy, the compassionate
Provost, and the hard-hearted Hangman; a young man of quality
who is to suffer for the seduction of his mistress before marriage,
loose wretches brought in by the police, nay, even a hardened
criminal whom the preparations for his execution cannot awake out
of his callousness. But yet, notwithstanding this convincing truth,
how tenderly and mildly the whole is treated! The piece takes
improperly its name from the punishment: the sense of the whole is
properly the triumph of mercy over strict justice, no man being himself
so secure from errors as to be entitled to deal it out among his
equals. The most beautiful ornament of the composition is the
character of Isabella, who, in the intention of taking the veil, allows
herself to be again prevailed on by pious love to tread the perplexing
ways of the world, while the heavenly purity of her mind is not even
stained with one unholy thought by the general corruption. In the
humble robes of the novice of a nunnery, she is a true angel of light.
When the cold and hitherto unsullied Angelo, whom the Duke has
commissioned to restrain the excess of dissolute immorality by a rigid
administration of the laws during his pretended absence, is even himself
tempted by the virgin charms of Isabella, as she supplicates for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>her brother Claudio; when he first insinuates, in timid and obscure
language, but at last impudently declares his readiness to grant the life
of Claudio for the sacrifice of her honour; when Isabella repulses
him with a noble contempt; when she relates what has happened to
her brother, and the latter at first applauds her, but at length, overpowered
by the dread of death, wishes to persuade her to consent to
her dishonour; in these masterly scenes Shakespear has sounded the
depth of the human heart. The interest here reposes altogether on
the action; curiosity constitutes no part of our delight; for the Duke,
in the disguise of a monk, is always present to watch over his
dangerous representatives, and to avert every evil which could possibly
be apprehended: we look here with confidence to the solemn decision.
The Duke acts the part of the Monk naturally, even to deception;
he unites in his person the wisdom of the priest and the prince. His
wisdom is merely too fond of roundabout ways; his vanity is flattered
with acting invisibly like an earthly providence; he is more entertained
with overhearing his subjects than governing them in the
customary manner. As he at last extends pardon to all the guilty,
we do not see how his original purpose of restoring the strictness of
the laws by committing the execution of them to other hands, has
been in any wise accomplished. The poet might have had this irony
in view—that of the numberless slanders of the Duke, told him by
the petulant Lucio, without knowing the person to whom he spoke,
what regarded his singularities and whims was not wholly without
foundation.</p>

<p class='c014'>‘It is deserving of remark, that Shakespear, amidst the rancour of
religious parties, takes a delight in representing the condition of a
monk, and always represents his influence as beneficial. We find in
him none of the black and knavish monks, which an enthusiasm for
the Protestant Religion, rather than poetical inspiration, has suggested
to some of our modern poets. Shakespear merely gives his monks
an inclination to busy themselves in the affairs of others, after
renouncing the world for themselves; with respect, however, to privy
frauds, he does not represent them as very conscientious. Such are
the parts acted by the Monk in Romeo and Juliet, and another in
Much ado about Nothing, and even by the Duke, whom, contrary to
the well known proverb, “the cowl seems really to make a monk.”’
Vol. ii. p. 169.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is, we confess, a very poor criticism on a very fine play; but
we are not in the humour (even if we could) to write a better. A
very obvious beauty, which has escaped the critic, is the admirable
description of life, as poetical as it is metaphysical, beginning, ‘If I
do lose thee, I do lose a thing,’ &amp;c. to the truth and justice of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Claudio assents, contrasted almost immediately afterwards with his
fine description of death as the worst of ills:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;</div>
      <div class='line'>This sensible warm motion to become</div>
      <div class='line'>A kneaded clod, and the delighted spirit</div>
      <div class='line'>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</div>
      <div class='line'>In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice.</div>
      <div class='line in14'>——’Tis too horrible!</div>
      <div class='line'>The weariest and most loathed worldly life</div>
      <div class='line'>That age, ache, penury, imprisonment,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can lay on nature, is a paradise</div>
      <div class='line'>To what we fear of death.’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Neither has he done justice to the character of Master Barnardine,
one of the finest (and that’s saying a bold word) in all Shakespear.
He calls him a hardened criminal. He is no such thing. He is
what he is by nature, not by circumstance, ‘careless, reckless, and
fearless of past, present, and to come.’ He is Caliban transported to
the forests of Bohemia, or the prisons of Vienna. He has, however,
a sense of the natural fitness of things: ‘He has been drinking hard
all night, and he will not be hanged that day,’ and Shakespear has
let him off at last. Emery does not play it well, for Master
Barnardine is not the representative of a Yorkshireman, but of an
universal class in nature. We cannot say that the Clown Pompey
suffered in the hands of Mr. Liston; on the contrary, he played it
inimitably well. His manner of saying ‘a dish of some three-pence’
was worth any thing. In the scene of his examination before the
Justice, he delayed, and dallied, and dangled in his answers, in the
true spirit of the genius of his author.</p>

<p class='c014'>We do not understand why the philosophical critic, whom we have
quoted above, should be so severe on those pleasant persons Lucio,
Pompey, and Master Froth, as to call them ‘wretches.’ They seem
all mighty comfortable in their occupations, and determined to pursue
them, ‘as the flesh and fortune should serve.’ Shakespear was the
least moral of all writers; for morality (commonly so called) is made
up of antipathies, and his talent consisted in sympathy with human
nature, in all its shapes, degrees, elevations, and depressions. The
object of the pedantic moralist is to make the worst of every thing;
<i>his</i> was to make the best, according to his own principle, ‘There is
some soul of goodness in things evil.’ Even Master Barnardine is
not left to the mercy of what others think of him, but when he comes
in, he speaks for himself. We would recommend it to the Society
for the Suppression of Vice to read Shakespear.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Young played the Duke tolerably well. As to the cant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>introduced into Schlegel’s account of the Duke’s assumed character
of a Monk, we scout it altogether. He takes advantage of the good-nature
of the poet to impose on the credulity of mankind. Chaucer
spoke of the Monks historically, Shakespear poetically. It was not
in the nature of Shakespear to insult over ‘the enemies of the human
race’ just after their fall. We however object to them entirely in
this age of the revival of Inquisitions and Protestant massacres. We
have not that stretch of philosophical comprehension which, in
German metaphysics, unites popery and free-thinking together, loyalty
and regicide, and which binds up the Bible and Spinoza in the same
volume!—Mr. Jones did not make a bad Lucio. Miss O’Neill’s
Isabella, though full of merit, disappointed us; as indeed she has
frequently done of late. Her ‘Oh fie, fie,’ was the most spirited
thing in her performance. She did not seize with much force the
spirit of her author, but she seemed in complete possession of a certain
conventicle twang. She whined and sang out her part in that querulous
tone that has become unpleasant to us by ceaseless repetition. She at
present plays all her parts in the Magdalen style. We half begin to
suspect that she represents the bodies, not the souls of women, and
that her <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is in tears, sighs, sobs, shrieks, and hysterics. She
does not play either Juliet or Isabella finely. She must stick to the
common-place characters of Otway, Moore, and Miss Hannah More,
or she will ruin herself. As Sir Joshua Reynolds concluded his last
lecture with the name of Michael Angelo, as Vetus wished the
name of the Marquis Wellesley to conclude his last letter, so we
will conclude this article with a devout apostrophe to the name of
Mrs. Siddons.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>February 18, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We saw Mr. Kean’s Sir Giles Overreach on Friday night from the
boxes at Drury-Lane Theatre, and are not surprised at the incredulity
as to this great actor’s powers, entertained by those persons who have
only seen him from that elevated sphere. We do not hesitate to say,
that those who have only seen him at that distance, have not seen
him at all. The expression of his face is quite lost, and only the
harsh and grating tones of his voice produce their full effect on the
ear. The same recurring sounds, by dint of repetition, fasten on the
attention, while the varieties and finer modulations are lost in their
passage over the pit. All you discover is an abstraction of his
defects, both of person, voice, and manner. He appears to be a
little man in a great passion. The accompaniment of expression is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>absolutely necessary to explain his tones and gestures: and the outline
which he gives of the character, in proportion as it is bold and
decided, requires to be filled up and modified by all the details of
execution. Without seeing the workings of his face, through which
you read the movements of his soul, and anticipate their violent effects
on his utterance and action, it is impossible to understand or feel
pleasure in the part. All strong expression, deprived of its gradations
and connecting motives, unavoidably degenerates into caricature.
This was the effect uniformly produced on those about us, who kept
exclaiming, ‘How extravagant, how odd,’ till the last scene, where
the extreme and admirable contrasts both of voice and gesture in
which Mr. Kean’s genius shews itself, and which are in their nature
more obviously intelligible, produced a change of opinion in his favour.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a proof of what we have above advanced, it was not possible to
discover in the last scene, where he is lifted from the ground by the
attendants, and he rivets his eyes in dreadful despair upon his daughter,
whether they were open or closed. The action of advancing to the
middle of the stage, and his faultering accent in saying, ‘Marall,
come hither, Marall,’ could not be mistaken. The applause, however,
came almost constantly from those who were near the orchestra, and
circulated in eddies round the house. It is unpleasant to see a play
from the boxes. There is no part of the house which is so thoroughly
wrapped up in itself, and fortified against any impression from what
is passing on the stage; which seems so completely weaned from all
superstitious belief in dramatic illusion; which takes so little interest
in all that is interesting. Not a cravat nor a muscle was discomposed,
except now and then by some gesticulation of Mr. Kean, which
violated the decorum of fashionable indifference, or by some expression
of the author, two hundred years old. Mr. Kean’s acting is not, we
understand, much relished in the upper circles. It is thought too
obtrusive and undisguised a display of nature. Neither was Garrick’s
at all relished at first, by the old Nobility, till it became the fashion
to admire him. The court dresses, the drawing-room strut, and the
sing-song declamation, which he banished from the stage, were
thought much more dignified and imposing.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>March 3, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Farquhar’s Comedy of the Recruiting Officer was revived at Drury-Lane
Theatre on Tuesday, when Mrs. Mardyn appeared as Sylvia.
She looked very charmingly in it while she continued in her female
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>dress, and displayed some good acting, particularly in the scene where
Plume gives her his will to read; but we did not like her at all as
Young Wilful, with her jockey coat, breeches, and boots. Her
dress seemed as if contrived on purpose to hide the beauties of her
natural shape, and discover its defects. A woman in Hessian boots
can no more move gracefully under such an additional and unusual
incumbrance to her figure, than a man could with a clog round each
leg. We hope that she will re-cast her male attire altogether, if she
has not already done it. The want of vivacity and elegance in her
appearance gave a flatness to the latter part of the comedy, which
was not relieved by the circumstance of Mr. Rae’s forgetting his
part. We do not think he played the airy, careless, lively Captain
Plume well; and Mr. Harley did not play <i>Captain</i> Brazen, but
<i>Serjeant</i> Brazen. Johnstone’s Serjeant Kite was not very happy.
Johnstone’s impudence is good-humoured and natural, Serjeant Kite’s
is knavish impudence. Johnstone is not exactly fitted for any
character, the failings of which do not lean to the amiable side.
There was one speech which entirely suited him, and that was where
he says to his Captain, ‘The mob are so pleased with your Honour,
and the justices and better sort of people are so delighted with me,
that we shall soon do our business!’ Munden’s Costar Pearmain,
and Knight’s Thomas Appletree, were a double treat. Knight’s
fixed, rivetted look at the guinea, accompanied with the exclamation,
‘Oh the wonderful works of Nature!’ and Munden’s open-mouthed,
reeling wonder, were in the best style of broad comic acting. If any
thing, this scene was even surpassed by that in which Munden, after
he has listed with Plume, makes his approximations to his friend,
who is whimpering, and casting at him a most inviting ogle, with an
expression of countenance all over oily and lubricated, emphatically
ejaculates, ‘Well, Tummy!’ We have no wish to see better acting
than this. This actor has won upon our good opinion, and we here
retract openly all that we have said disrespectfully of his talents,
generally speaking. Miss Kelly’s Rose was played <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>; it
was an exquisite exhibition of rustic <i>naiveté</i>. Her riding on the
basket as a side-saddle, was very spirited and well contrived. Passion
expresses itself in such characters by a sort of uneasy bodily vivacity,
which no actress gives so well as Miss Kelly. We ought not
to omit, that she cries her chickens in a good shrill huswifely
market-voice, as if she would drive a good bargain with them. Mr.
Powell played Justice Balance as well as if he had been the Justice
himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Recruiting Officer is not one of Farquhar’s best comedies,
though it is lively and entertaining. It contains merely sketches of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>characters, and the conclusion of the plot is rather lame. He
informs us in the dedication to the published play, that it was
founded on some local and personal circumstances that happened in
Shropshire, where he was a recruiting officer, and it seems not
unlikely that most of the scenes actually took place near the foot of
the Wrekin.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE FAIR PENITENT</h3>

</div>

<div class='c026'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>March 10, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Fair Penitent is a tragedy which has been found fault with
both on account of its poetry and its morality. Notwithstanding these
objections, it still holds possession of the stage, where morality is not
very eagerly sought after, and poetry but imperfectly understood.
We conceive, that for every purpose of practical criticism, that is a
good tragedy which draws tears without moving laughter. Rowe’s
play is founded on one of Massinger’s, the Fatal Dowry, in which
the characters are a good deal changed, and the interest not increased.
The genius of Rowe was slow and timid, and loved the ground: he
had not ‘a Muse of fire to ascend the brightest heaven of invention:’
but he had art and judgment enough to accommodate the more daring
flights of a ruder age to the polished well-bred mediocrity of the age
he lived in. We may say of Rowe as Voltaire said of Racine:
‘All his lines are equally good.’ The compliment is after all
equivocal; but it is one which may be applied generally to all poets,
who in their productions are always thinking of what they shall say,
and of what others have said, and who are never hurried into excesses
of any kind, good or bad, by trusting implicitly to the impulse of
their own genius or of the subject. The excellent author of Tom
Jones, in one of his introductory chapters, represents Rowe as an
awkward imitator of Shakespear. He was rather an imitator of the
style and tone of sentiment of that age,—a sort of modernizer of
antiquity. The character of Calista is quite in the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravura</span></i> style of
Massinger. She is a heroine, a virago, fair, a woman of high spirit
and violent resolutions, any thing but a penitent. She dies indeed at
last, not from remorse for her vices, but because she can no longer
gratify them. She has not the slightest regard for her virtue, and
not much for her reputation; but she would brand with scorn, and
blast with the lightning of her indignation, the friend who wishes to stop
her in the career of her passions in order to save her from destruction
and infamy. She has a strong sentiment of respect and attachment to
her father, but she will sooner consign his grey hairs to shame and death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>than give up the least of her inclinations, or sacrifice her sullen gloom
to the common decencies of behaviour. She at last pretends conversion
from her errors, in a soft whining address to her husband, and after
having deliberately and wantonly done all the mischief in her power,
with her eyes open, wishes that she had sooner known better, that
she might have acted differently! We do not however for ourselves
object to the morality of all this: for we apprehend that morality is
little more than truth; and we think that Rowe has given a very
true and striking picture of the nature and consequences of that wilful
selfishness of disposition, ‘which to be hated needs but to be seen.’
We do not think it necessary that the spectator should wait for the
reluctant conversion of the character itself, to be convinced of its
odiousness or folly, or that the only instruction to be derived from
the drama is, not from the insight it gives us into the nature of
human character and passion, but from some artificial piece of patchwork
morality tacked to the end. However, Rowe has so far
complied with the rules.</p>

<p class='c014'>After what we have said of the character of Calista, Miss O’Neill
will perhaps excuse us if we do not think that she was a very perfect
representative of it. The character, as she gave it, was a very fine
and impressive piece of acting, but it was not quite Calista. She
gave the pathos, but not the spirit of the character. Her grief was
sullen and sad, not impatient and ungovernable. Calista’s melancholy
is not a settled dejection, but a feverish state of agitation between
conflicting feelings. Her eyes should look bright and sparkling
through her tears. Her action should be animated and aspiring.
Her present woes should not efface the traces of past raptures.
There should be something in her appearance of the intoxication of
pleasure, mixed with the madness of despair. The scene in which
Miss O’Neill displayed most power, was that in which she is shewn
her letter to Lothario by Horatio, her husband’s friend. The rage
and shame with which her bosom seemed labouring were truly
dreadful. This is the scene in which the poet has done most for the
imagination, and it is the characteristic excellence of Miss O’Neill’s
acting, that it always rises with the expectations of the audience.
She also repeated the evasive answer, ‘It was the day in which my
father gave my hand to Altamont—as such I shall remember it
for ever,’ in a tone of deep and suppressed emotion. It is needless
to add, that she played the part with a degree of excellence which
no other actress could approach, and that she was only inferior to
herself in it, because there is not the same opportunity for the display
of her inimitable powers, as in some of her other characters.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE DUKE OF MILAN</h3>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>March 17, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We do not think the Duke of Milan will become so great a
favourite as Sir Giles Overreach, at Drury-Lane Theatre. The
first objection to this play is, that it is an arbitrary falsification of
history. There is nothing in the life of Sforza, the supposed hero
of the piece, to warrant the account of the extravagant actions and
tragical end which are here attributed to him, to say nothing of
political events. In the second place, his resolution to destroy his
wife, to whom he is passionately attached, rather than bear the
thought of her surviving him, is as much out of the verge of nature
and probability, as it is unexpected and revolting from the want of
any circumstances of palliation leading to it. It stands out alone,
a piece of pure voluntary atrocity, which seems not the dictate of
passion but a start of phrenzy. From the first abrupt mention
of this design to his treacherous accomplice, Francesco, he loses
the favour, and no longer excites the sympathy of the audience.
Again, Francesco is a person whose actions we are at a loss to
explain, till the last act of the piece, when the attempt to account
for them from motives originally amiable and generous, only produces
a double sense of incongruity, and instead of satisfying the mind,
renders it totally incredulous. He endeavours to debauch the wife
of his benefactor, he then attempts her death, slanders her foully,
and wantonly causes her to be slain by the hand of her husband, and
has him poisoned by a deliberate stratagem; and all this to appease
a high sense of injured honour, ‘which felt a stain like a wound,’
and from the tender overflowings of fraternal affection; his sister
having, it appears, been formerly betrothed to, and afterwards deserted
by the Duke.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the original play, the Duke is killed by a poison which is spread
by Francesco over the face of the deceased Duchess, whose lips her
husband fondly kisses, though cold in death, in the distracted state
into which he is plunged by remorse for his rash act. But in the
acted play, it is so contrived, that the sister of Francesco personates
the murdered Duchess, and poisons the Duke (as it is concerted
with her brother), by holding a flower in her hand, which, as he
squeezes it, communicates the infection it has received from some
juice in which it has been steeped. How he is to press the flower
in her hand, in such a manner as not to poison her as well as
himself, is left unexplained. The lady, however, does not die, and
a reconciliation takes place between her and her former lover.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>We hate these sickly sentimental endings, without any meaning in
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>The peculiarity of Massinger’s vicious characters seems in general
to be, that they are totally void of moral sense, and have a gloating
pride and disinterested pleasure in their villanies, unchecked by the
common feelings of humanity. Francesco, in the present play, holds
it out to the last, defies his enemies, and is ‘proud to die what he
was born.’ At other times, after the poet has carried on one of
these hardened unprincipled characters for a whole play, he is seized
with a sudden qualm of conscience, and his villain is visited with a
judicial remorse. This is the case with Sir Giles Overreach, whose
hand is restrained in the last extremity of his rage by ‘some widow’s
curse that hangs upon it,’ and whose heart is miraculously melted
‘by orphan’s tears.’ We will not, however, deny that such may be
a true picture of the mixed barbarity and superstition of the age in
which Massinger wrote. We have no doubt that his Sir Giles
Overreach, which some have thought an incredible exaggeration,
was an actual portrait. Traces of such characters are still to be
found in some parts of the country, and in classes to which modern
refinement and modern education have not penetrated;—characters
that not only make their own selfishness and violence the sole rule
of their actions, but triumph in the superiority which their want of
feeling and of principle gives them over their opponents or dependants.
In the time of Massinger, philosophy had made no progress in the
minds of country gentlemen: nor had the theory of moral sentiments,
in the community at large, been fashioned and moulded into shape by
systems of ethics continually pouring in upon us from the Universities
of Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Aberdeen. Persons in the situation,
and with the dispositions of Sir Giles, cared not what wrong they
did, nor what was thought of it, if they had only the power to
maintain it. There is no calculating the advantages of civilization
and letters, in taking off the hard, coarse edge of rusticity, and in
softening social life. The vices of refined and cultivated periods
are <i>personal</i> vices, such as proceed from too unrestrained a pursuit of
pleasure in ourselves, not from a desire to inflict pain on others.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean’s Sforza is not his most striking character; on the
contrary, it is one of his least impressive, and least successful ones.
The mad scene was fine, but we have seen him do better. The
character is too much at cross-purposes with itself, and before the
actor has time to give its full effect to any impulse of passion, it is
interrupted and broken off by some caprice or change of object. In
Mr. Kean’s representation of it, our expectations were often excited,
but never thoroughly satisfied, and we were teased with a sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>littleness in every part of it. It entirely wants the breadth, force,
and grandeur of his Sir Giles.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the scenes, a view of the court-house at Milan, was most
beautiful. Indeed, the splendour of the scenery and dresses frequently
took away from the effect of Mr. Kean’s countenance.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>March 24, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Miss O’Neill’s Lady Teazle at Covent-Garden Theatre appears
to us to be a complete failure. It was not comic; it was not
elegant; it was not easy; it was not dignified; it was not playful;
it was not any thing that it ought to be. All that can be said of it
is, that it was not tragedy. It seemed as if all the force and pathos
which she displays in interesting situations had left her, but that not
one spark of gaiety, one genuine expression of delight, had come in
their stead. It was a piece of laboured heavy <i>still-life</i>. The only
thing that had an air of fashion about her was the feather in her
hat. It was not merely that she did not succeed as Miss O’Neill;
it would have been a falling off in the most common-place actress
who had ever done any thing tolerably. She gave to the character
neither the complete finished air of fashionable indifference, which
was the way in which Miss Farren played it, if we remember right,
nor that mixture of artificial refinement and natural vivacity, which
appears to be the true idea of the character (which however is not
very well made out), but she seemed to have been thrust by some
injudicious caprice of fortune, into a situation for which she was
fitted neither by nature nor education. There was a perpetual
affectation of the wit and the fine lady, with an evident consciousness
of effort, a desire to please without any sense of pleasure.
It was no better than awkward mimicry of the part, and more like
a drawling imitation of Mrs. C. Kemble’s genteel comedy than any
thing else we have seen. The concluding penitential speech was
an absolute sermon. We neither liked her manner of repeating
‘Mimminee pimminee,’ nor of describing the lady who rides round
the ring in Hyde-park, nor of chucking Sir Peter under the chin,
which was a great deal too coarse and familiar. There was throughout
an equal want of delicacy and spirit, of ease and effect, of nature and
art. It was in general flat and insipid, and where any thing more
was attempted, it was overcharged and unpleasant.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fawcett’s Sir Peter Teazle was better than when we last saw it.
He is an actor of much merit, but he has of late got into a strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>way of slurring over his parts. Liston’s Sir Benjamin Backbite was
not very successful. Charles Kemble played Charles Surface very
delightfully.</p>

<p class='c018'>Guy Mannering, or the Gipsey’s Prophecy, taken from the novel
of that name, and brought out at Covent-Garden, is a very pleasing
romantic drama. It is, we understand, from the pen of Mr. Terry,
and reflects much credit on his taste and talents. The scenes between
Miss Stephens, Miss Matthews, and Mr. Abbott, as Lucy Bertram,
Julia Mannering, and Colonel Mannering, have a high degree of
elegance and interest. Mrs. Egerton’s Meg Merrilees was equal in
force and nature to her Miller’s Wife; and we cannot pay it a higher
compliment. It makes the blood run cold. Mr. Higman played the
chief Gipsey very well, and nothing could be better represented than
the unfeeling, shuffling tricks and knavish impudence of the Gipsey
Boy, by Master Williams. Liston’s Dominie Sampson was <i>prodigious</i>;
his talents are <i>prodigious</i>. The appearance and the interest he gave
to the part were quite patriarchal. The unconscious simplicity of
the humour was exquisite; it will give us a better opinion of the
Scotch Clergy, and almost of the Scotch nation (if that were possible)
while we live.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>March 31, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A chasm has been produced in the amusements of Drury-Lane
Theatre by the accident which has happened to Mr. Kean. He was
to have played the Duke of Milan on Tuesday, but as he had not
come to the Theatre at the time of the drawing up of the curtain,
Mr. Rae came forward to propose another tragedy, Douglas. To
this the audience did not assent, and wished to wait. Mr. Kean,
however, not appearing, nor any tidings being heard of him, he
was at length given up, and two farces substituted in his stead.
Conjectures and rumours were afloat; and it was not till the next
day that it was discovered that Mr. Kean having dined a few miles
in the country, and returning at a very quick pace to keep his
engagement at the Theatre, was thrown out of his gig, and had his
arm dislocated, besides being stunned and very much bruised with
the fall. On this accident a grave morning paper is pleased to be
facetious. It observes that this is a very <i>serious</i> accident; that
actors in general are liable to <i>serious</i> accidents; that the late Mr.
Cooke used to meet with <i>serious</i> accidents; that it is a sad thing to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>be in the way of such accidents; and that it is to be hoped that
Mr. Kean will meet with no more <i>serious</i> accidents. It is to be
hoped that he will not—nor with any such profound observations
upon them, if they should happen. Next to that spirit of bigotry
which in a neighbouring country would deny actors Christian burial
after death, we hate that cant of criticism, which slurs over their
characters while living with a half-witted jest. Actors are accused
as a profession of being extravagant and intemperate. While they
are said to be so as a piece of common cant, they are likely to
continue so. But there is a sentence in Shakespear which should
be stuck as a label in the mouths of the beadles and whippers-in
of morality: ‘The web of our life is of a mingled yarn: our virtues
would be proud if our vices whipped them not, and our faults would
despair if they were not cherished by our virtues.’</p>

<p class='c014'>With respect to the extravagance of actors, as a traditional
character, it is not to be wondered at: they live from hand to
mouth; they plunge from want into luxury; they have no means
of making money <i>breed</i>, and all professions that do not live by
turning money into money, or have not a certainty of accumulating it
in the end by parsimony, spend it. Uncertain of the future, they
make sure of the present moment. This is not unwise. Chilled
with poverty, steeped in contempt, they sometimes pass into the sunshine
of fortune, and are lifted to the very pinnacle of public favour,
yet even there cannot calculate on the continuance of success, but are,
‘like the giddy sailor on the mast, ready with every blast to topple
down into the fatal bowels of the deep!’ Besides, if the young
enthusiast who is smitten with the stage, and with the public as a
mistress, were naturally a close <i>hunks</i>, he would become or remain
a city clerk, instead of turning player. Again, with respect to the
habit of convivial indulgence, an actor, to be a good one, must have
a great spirit of enjoyment in himself, strong impulses, strong passions,
and a strong sense of pleasure, for it is his business to imitate the
passions and to communicate pleasure to others. A man of genius is
not a machine. The neglected actor may be excused if he drinks
oblivion of his disappointments; the successful one, if he quaffs the
applause of the world, and enjoys the friendship of those who are the
friends of the favourites of fortune, in draughts of nectar. There is
no path so steep as that of fame; no labour so hard as the pursuit
of excellence. The intellectual excitement inseparable from those
professions which call forth all our sensibility to pleasure and pain,
requires some corresponding physical excitement to support our
failure, and not a little to allay the ferment of the spirits attendant
on success. If there is any tendency to dissipation beyond this in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>the profession of a player, it is owing to the state of public opinion,
which paragraphs like the one we have alluded to are not calculated
to reform; and players are only not so <i>respectable</i> as a profession as
they might be, because their profession is not <i>respected</i> as it ought
to be.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is something, we fear, impertinent and uncalled for in these
remarks: the more so, as in the present instance the insinuation
which they were meant to repel is wholly unfounded. We have
it on very good authority, that Mr. Kean, since his engagement at
Drury-Lane, and during his arduous and uninterrupted exertions in
his profession, has never missed a single rehearsal, nor been absent a
minute beyond the time for beginning his part.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>April 7, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean’s friends felt some unnecessary anxiety with respect to
his reception in the part of Shylock, on Monday night at Drury-Lane,
being his first appearance after his recovery from his accident,
which we are glad to find has not been a very serious one. On his
coming on the stage there was a loud burst of applause and welcome;
but as this was mixed with some hisses, Mr. Kean came forward, and
spoke nearly as follows:</p>

<p class='c024'>‘Ladies and Gentlemen, for the first time in my life I have been the
unfortunate cause of disappointing the public amusement.</p>

<p class='c021'>‘That it is the only time, on these boards, I can appeal to your own
recollection; and when you take into calculation the 265 times that I have
had the honour to appear before you, according to the testimony of the
Manager’s books, you will, perhaps, be able to make some allowance.</p>

<p class='c021'>‘To your favour I owe all the reputation I enjoy.</p>

<p class='c021'>‘I rely on your candour, that prejudice shall not rob me of what your
kindness has conferred upon me.’</p>

<p class='c009'>This address was received with cordial cheers, and the play went
forward without interruption. As soon as the curtain drew up,
some persons had absurdly called out ‘Kean, Kean,’ though Shylock
does not appear in the first scenes. This was construed into a call
for ‘God save the <i>King</i>:’ and the Duke of Gloucester’s being in
one of the stage-boxes seemed to account for this sudden effusion of
loyalty,—a sentiment indeed always natural in the hearts of Englishmen,
but at present not very noisy, and rather ‘deep than loud.’ For
our own parts, we love the King according to law, but we cannot sing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shylock was the part in which Mr. Kean first sought the favour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>of the town, and in which perhaps he chose for that reason to be
reconciled to it, after the first slight misunderstanding. We were
a little curious on this occasion to see the progress he has made in
public opinion since that time; and on turning to our theatrical
common-place book (there is nothing like a common-place book
after all) found the following account of his first reception, copied
from the most respectable of the Morning Papers: ‘Mr. Kean
(of whom report has spoken so highly) made his appearance at
Drury-Lane in the character of Shylock. For <i>voice</i>, eye, action,
and expression, no actor has come out for many years at all equal
to him. The applause, from the first scene to the last, was general,
loud, and uninterrupted. Indeed, the very first scene in which he
comes on with Bassanio and Anthonio, shewed the master in his art,
and at once decided the opinion of the audience. Perhaps it was the
most perfect of any. Notwithstanding the complete success of Mr.
Kean in Shylock, we question whether he will not become a greater
favourite in other parts. There was a lightness and vigour in his
tread, a buoyancy and elasticity of spirit, a fire and animation, which
would accord better with almost any other character than with the
morose, sullen, inward, inveterate, inflexible, malignity of Shylock.
The character of Shylock is that of a man brooding over one idea,
that of its wrongs, and bent on an unalterable purpose, that of revenge.
In conveying a profound impression of this feeling, or in embodying
the general conception of rigid and uncontroulable  self-will, equally
proof against every sentiment of humanity or prejudice of opinion, we
have seen actors more successful than Mr. Kean. But in giving
effect to the conflict of passions arising out of the contrast of situation,
in varied vehemence of declamation, in keenness of sarcasm, in the
rapidity of his transitions from one tone or feeling to another, in
propriety and novelty of action, presenting a succession of striking
pictures, and giving perpetually fresh shocks of delight and surprise,
it would be difficult to single out a competitor. The fault of his
acting was (if we may hazard an objection), an over-display of the
resources of the art, which gave too much relief to the hard, impenetrable,
dark ground-work of the character of Shylock. It would
be needless to point out individual beauties, where almost every
passage was received with equal and deserved applause. His style of
acting is, if we may use the expression, more significant, more
pregnant with meaning, more varied and alive in every part, than any
we have almost ever witnessed. The character never stands still;
there is no vacant pause in the action: the eye is never silent. It is
not saying too much of Mr. Kean, though it is saying a great deal,
that he has all that Mr. Kemble <i>wants</i> of perfection.’</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>The accounts in the other papers were not to be sure so favourable;
and in the above criticism there are several errors. His voice,
which is here praised, is very bad, though it must be confessed its
defects appear less in Shylock than in most of his other characters.
The critic appears also to have formed an overstrained idea of the
gloomy character of Shylock, probably more from seeing other
players perform it than from the text of Shakespear. Mr. Kean’s
manner is much nearer the mark. Shakespear could not easily divest
his characters of their entire humanity: his Jew is more than half a
Christian. Certainly, our sympathies are much oftener with him
than with his enemies. He is honest in his vices; they are
hypocrites in their virtues. In all his arguments and replies he has
the advantage over them, by taking them on their own ground.
Shylock (however some persons may suppose him bowed down by
age, or deformed with malignity) never, that we can find, loses his
elasticity and presence of mind. There is wonderful grace and ease
in all the speeches in this play. ‘I would not have parted with it
(the jewel that he gave to Leah) for a <i>wilderness</i> of monkeys!’
What a fine Hebraism! The character of Shylock is another
instance of Shakespear’s powers of identifying himself with the
thoughts of men, their prejudices, and almost instincts.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE ORATORIOS</h3>

<div class='c026'><i>April 14, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Oratorios are over, and we are not sorry for it. Not that
we are not fond of music; on the contrary, there is nothing that
affects us so much; but the note it sounds is of too high a sphere.
It lifts the soul to heaven, but in so doing, it exhausts the faculties,
draws off the ethereal and refined part of them, and we fall back to
the earth more dull and lumpish than ever. Music is the breath of
thought; the audible movement of the heart. It is, for the most
part, a pure effusion of sentiment; the language of pleasure, abstracted
from its exciting causes. But the human mind is so formed, that it
cannot easily bear, for any length of time, an uninterrupted appeal to
the sense of pleasure alone; we require the relief of objects and
ideas; it may be said that the activity of the soul, of the voluptuous
part of our nature, cannot keep pace with that of the understanding,
which only discerns the outward differences of things. All passion
exhausts the mind; and that kind of passion most, which presents no
distinct object to the imagination. The eye may amuse itself for a
whole day with the variety to be found in a florist’s garden; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>sense is soon cloyed with the smell of the sweetest flowers, and we
throw them from us as if they had been weeds. The sounds of
music are like perfumes, ‘exhaling to the sky;’ too sweet to last;
that must be borne to us on the passing breeze, not pressed and held
close to the sense; the warbling of heavenly voices in the air, not the
ordinary language of men. If music is (as it is said to be) the
language of angels, poetry is the most perfect language men can use:
for poetry is music also, and has as much of the soft and voluptuous
in its nature, as the hard and unyielding materials of our composition
will bear. Music is colour without form; a soul without a body; a
mistress whose face is veiled; an invisible goddess.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Oratorios at Covent-Garden are in general much better than
those at Drury-Lane: this year they have had Braham, Miss
Stephens, Madam Marconi, and, if that were any great addition,
Madame Mainville Fodor. Of this last lady it may be said, that she
‘has her exits and her entrances,’ and that is nearly all you know of
her. She was encored in one song, ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah pardonna</span>,’ to her evident
chagrin. Her airs of one kind scarcely make amends for her airs of
another. Her voice is clear and forcible, and has a kind of deep
internal volume, which seems to be artificially suppressed. Her hard,
firm style of execution (something like the dragging of the painter’s
pencil) gives a greater relief to the occasional sweetness and power of
tone which she displays. Her taste in singing is severe and fastidious;
and this is, we suppose, the reason that a connoisseur of great
eminence compared it to Titian’s colouring. Madam Marconi, on
the contrary, has a broad and full manner; sings with all her might,
and pours out her whole soul and voice. There is something
masculine, and we might say, rather vulgar, in her tones, if her native
Italian or broken English did not prevent such a suggestion almost
before it rises in the mind. Miss Stephens sang with more than her
usual spirit, and was much applauded, particularly in ‘The mower
wets his scythe,’ &amp;c.; but we do not think her <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is in concert-music.
Mr. Braham’s certainly is; and his power is thrown away
on the ballad airs which he sings in general on the stage. The
sweetness of his voice becomes languishing and effeminate, unless
where it is sustained by its depth and power. But on these occasions
there is a rich mellifluous tone in his cadences, which is like that of
bees swarming; his chest is dilated; he heaves the loud torrent
of sound, like a load, from his heart; his voice rises in thunder, and
his whole frame is inspired with the god! He sung Luther’s Hymn
very finely, with the exception of one quavering falsetto. This
appears to our ignorant fancies at once the simplest and sublimest of
compositions. The whole expresses merely the alternations of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>respiration, the heaving or drawing in of the breath, with the rising
or sinking of hope or fear. It is music to which the dead might
awake! On the last night of the Covent-Garden Oratorio, the
beginning of Haydn’s Creation was played. It is the accompaniment
to the words, ‘And God said let there be light,’ &amp;c. The adaptation
of sound to express certain ideas, is most ingenious and admirable.
The rising of the sun is described by a crashing and startling movement
of sounds in all directions, like the effulgence of its rays
sparkling through the sky; and the moon is made to rise to a
slow and subdued symphony, like sound muffled, or like the moon
emerging from a veil of mist, according to that description in
Milton,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>‘Till the moon</div>
      <div class='line'>Rising in clouded majesty, at length</div>
      <div class='line'>Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The stars also are represented twinkling in the blue abyss, by
intervals of sweet sounds just audible. The art, however, by which
this is done, is perhaps too little natural to please.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mons. Drouet’s performance on the flute was masterly, as far
as we could judge. The execution of his variations on ‘God save
the King,’ astonished and delighted the connoisseurs. Those on
‘Hope told a flattering tale,’ were also exquisite. We are, however,
deep-versed in the sentiment of this last air; and we lost it in
the light and fantastic movements of Mons. Drouet’s execution.
He belongs, we apprehend, to that class of musicians, whose ears
are at their fingers’ ends; but he is perhaps at the head. We
profess, however, to be very ignorant in these matters, and speak
under correction.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>April 21, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The Managers of Covent-Garden Theatre have treated the public
with two new Richards this season, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. Cobham.
The first, his own good sense and modesty induced to withdraw,
after the disapprobation of the public had been expressed on his first
trial. Mr. Cobham, who is not ‘made of penetrable stuff,’ intends,
we understand, to face the public out in the character. This is an
experiment which will never answer. We shall take good care,
however, not to be present at the fray. We do not blame Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Cobham for the mortification and disappointment which we have
received, but the Managers. Self-knowledge is a rare acquisition;
but criticism upon others is a very easy task; and the Managers need
merely have perceived as much of the matter as was obvious to every
common spectator from the first moment of this actor’s coming on,
to know that it was quite impossible he should get through the part
with ordinary decency. The only scene that was tolerable was the
meeting with Lady Anne. But for his Richard—(Heaven save the
mark)—it was a vile one—‘unhousell’d, unanointed, unaneal’d, with
all his imperfections on his head.’ Not that this actor is without
the physical requisites to play Richard: he raved, whined, grinned,
stared, stamped, and rolled his eyes with incredible velocity, and all
in the right place according to his cue, but in so extravagant and disjointed
a manner, and with such a total want of common sense,
decorum, or conception of the character, as to be perfectly ridiculous.
We suspect that he has a wrong theory of his art. He has taken a
lesson from Mr. Kean, whom he caricatures, and seems to suppose
that to be familiar or violent is natural, and that to be natural is the
perfection of acting. And so it is, if properly understood. But to
play Richard naturally, is to play it as Richard would play it, not as
Mr. Cobham would play it; he comes there to shew us not himself,
but the tyrant and the king—not what he would do, but what another
would do in such circumstances. Before he can do this he must
become that other, and cease to be himself. Dignity is natural to
certain stations, and grandeur of expression to certain feelings. In
art, nature cannot exist without the highest art; it is a pure effort of
the imagination, which throws the mind out of itself into the supposed
situation of others, and enables it to feel and act there as if it were
at home. The real Richard and the real Mr. Cobham are quite
different things.</p>

<p class='c018'>But we are glad to have done with this subject, and proceed to a
more grateful one, which is to notice the Sir Pertinax Mac Sycophant
of a Gentleman whose name has not yet been announced.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c015'><sup>[38]</sup></a> We have
no hesitation in pronouncing him an acquisition to this Theatre. To
compare him with Cooke in this character would be idle; for it was
Cooke’s very best character, and Cooke was one of the very best
actors we have had on the stage. But he played the character
throughout without a single failure, and with great judgment, great
spirit, and great effect. In the scenes with Egerton, where he gives
a loose to his natural feelings, he expressed all the turbulence and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>irritation of his mind without losing sight of his habitual character or
external demeanour. He has a great deal of that assumed decorum
and imposing stateliness of manner, which, since the days of Jack
Palmer, has been a desideratum on the stage. In short, we have
had no one who looked at home in a full dress coat and breeches.
Besides the more obvious requisites for the stage, the bye-play of the
new actor is often excellent: his eye points what he is going to say;
he has a very significant smile, and a very alarming shrug with his
shoulders. The only objection that we have to make is to the too
frequent repetition of a certain motion with the hands which may
easily be avoided.</p>

<p class='c014'>During a part of the representation there was some opposition most
absurdly manifested: partly from its being Easter week, partly from
persons who did not understand Scotch, and still more, we apprehend,
from those who did. Sir Pertinax has always been an obnoxious
<i>up-hill</i> character, and hazardous to a debutant. We see no reason for
this on a London stage. The Irish say, that we laugh at them on
the stage: why then should we not laugh at the Scotch? The
answer is—that we laugh at the Irish, to be sure, but we do not
make them odious.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>April 28, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Romeo and Juliet was played at Drury-Lane to introduce a new
candidate for public favour, Miss Grimani, as Juliet, and to show off
a very old one, Mr. Rae as Romeo. This lady has one qualification
for playing the part of Juliet which is, that she is very pretty; but
we are afraid that’s all. Her voice in common speaking is thin and
lisping, and when she raises it, it becomes harsh and unmanageable,
as if she had learned to speak of ——. We cannot however
pretend to say how far her timidity might interfere with the display
of her powers. Mr. Rae cannot plead the same excuse of modesty
for the faults of his acting. Between the tragi-comedy of his voice
and the drollery of his action, we were exceedingly amused. His
manner of saying, ‘How silver sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,’
was more like ‘the midnight bell that with his iron tongue and brazen
mouth sounds one unto the drowsy race of night;’ and his hurried
mode of getting over the description of the Apothecary, was as if a
person should be hired to repeat this speech after ten miles hard
riding on a high trotting horse. When this ‘gentle tassel’ is lured
back in the garden by his Juliet’s voice, he returns at full speed, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>a harlequin going to take a flying leap through a trap-door. This
was, we suppose, to give us an allegorical idea of his being borne on
the wings of love, but we could discover neither his wings nor his
love. The rest of the play was very indifferently got up, except the
Nurse by Mrs. Sparks.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the play, we had Garrick’s Ode on Shakespear, and a procession
of Shakespear’s characters in dumb-show. Mr. Pope recited
the Ode, and personated the Genius of Shakespear as the Wool-sack
personates the Prince Regent. ‘Vesuvius in an eruption, was not
more violent than his utterance, not Pelion with all his pine-trees in
a storm of wind more impetuous than his action: and yet Drury-Lane
still stands.’ We have here used the words of Gray, in describing a
University Orator at a Cambridge Installation. The result, as given
by the poet, was more agreeable than in the present instance.—‘I
was ready to sink for him, and scarce dared look about me, when
I was sure it was all over: but soon I found I might have spared
my confusion: all people joined to applaud him. Every thing was
quite right, and I dare swear not three people here but think him
a model of oratory: for all the Duke’s little court came with a
resolution to be pleased: and when the tone was once given, the
University, who ever wait for the judgment of their betters, struck
into it with an admirable harmony; for the rest of the performances,
they were just what they usually are. Every one, while it lasted,
was very gay and very busy in the morning, and very owlish and
very tipsy at night: I make no exceptions from the Chancellor to
Blue-coat.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Pope did not get off so well as the Cambridge Orator, for
Garrick’s Ode ‘was sung, but broke off in the middle’ by the shouts
and laughter of the audience, less well-bred than the grave assembly
above described: nor was any one in the situation of the Chancellor
or Blue-coat. We are free to confess, that we think the recitation of
an Ode requires the assistance of good eating and drinking to carry it
off; and this is perhaps the reason that there is such good eating and
drinking at our Universities, where the reciting of Odes and other
formal productions is common.</p>

<p class='c014'>After the Ode, the Mulberry Tree was sung by Mr. Pyne and
Mr. Smith, not in the garden, but in the street, before the house
where Shakespear was born. This violation of the unity of place
confounded the sentiment, nor was the uncertainty cleared up by a
rabble of attendants, (more unintelligible than the Chorus of the
ancients), who resembled neither waiters with tavern bills in their
hands, nor musicians with their scores.</p>

<p class='c014'>The singing being over, the procession of Characters commenced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>and we were afraid would have ended fatally; for Mrs. Bartley, as
the Tragic Muse, was nearly upset by the breaking down of her car.
We cannot go through the detail of this wretched burlesque. Mr.
Stothard’s late picture of the Characters of Shakespear was ingenious
and satisfactory, because the figures seen together made picturesque
groups, because painting presents but one moment of action, and
because it is necessarily in dumb show. But this exhibition seemed
intended as a travestie, to take off all the charm and the effect of the
ideas associated with the several characters. It has satisfied us of
the reality of dramatic illusion, by shewing the effect of such an
exhibition entirely stripped of it. For example, Juliet is wheeled on
in her tomb, which is broken open by her lover: she awakes, the
tomb then moves forward, and Mr. S. Penley, not knowing what to
do, throws himself upon the bier, and is wheeled off with her.
Pope and Barnard come on as Lear and Mad Tom. They sit down
on the ground, and Pope steals a crown of straw from his companion:
Mad Tom then starts up, runs off the stage, and Pope after him, like
Pantaloon in pursuit of the Clown. This is fulsome. We did not
stay to see it out; and one consolation is, that we shall not be alive
another century to see it repeated.</p>

rope-dancing, fire-works, play-bill puffs, and by every kind of quackery,

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>We do not know why we promised last week to give some account
of Mr. Kemble’s Sir Giles, except that we dreaded the task then;
and certainly our reluctance to speak on this subject has not decreased,
the more we have thought upon it since. We have hardly ever
experienced a more painful feeling than when, after the close of the
play, the sanguine plaudits of Mr. Kemble’s friends, and the circular
discharge of hisses from the back of the pit, that came ‘full volly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>home,’—the music struck up, the ropes were fixed, and Madame
Sachi ran up from the stage to the two-shilling gallery, and then ran
down again, as fast as her legs could carry her, amidst the shouts of
pit, boxes, and gallery!</p>

      <div class='line'>Sceptres and palms of all the mighty.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>We have here marred some fine lines of Mr. Wordsworth on the
instability of human greatness, but it is no matter: for he does not
seem to understand the sentiment himself. Mr. Kemble, then,
having been thrust into the part, as we suppose, against his will, run
the gauntlet of public opinion in it with a firmness and resignation
worthy of a Confessor. He did not once shrink from his duty, nor
make one effort to redeem his reputation, by ‘affecting a virtue when
he knew he had it not.’ He seemed throughout to say to his
instigators, <i>You have thrust me into this part, help me out of it, if you
can; for you see I cannot help myself</i>. We never saw signs of greater
poverty, greater imbecility and decrepitude in Mr. Kemble, or in any
other actor: it was Sir Giles in his dotage. It was all ‘Well, well,’
and, ‘If you like it, have it so,’ an indifference and disdain of what
was to happen, a nicety about his means, a coldness as to his ends,
much gentility and little nature. Was this Sir Giles Overreach?
Nothing could be more quaint and out-of-the-way. Mr. Kemble
wanted the part to come to him, for he would not go out of his way
to the part. He is, in fact, as shy of committing himself with nature,
as a maid is of committing herself with a lover. All the proper
forms and ceremonies must be complied with, before ‘they two can
be made one flesh.’ Mr. Kemble sacrifices too much to decorum.
He is chiefly afraid of being contaminated by too close an identity
with the characters he represents. This is the greatest vice in an
actor, who ought never to <i>bilk</i> his part. He endeavours to raise
Nature to the dignity of his own person and demeanour, and declines
with a graceful smile and a waive of the hand, the ordinary services
she might do him. We would advise him by all means to shake
hands, to hug her close, and be friends, if we did not suspect it was
too late—that the lady, owing to this coyness, has eloped, and is now
in the situation of Dame Hellenore among the Satyrs.</p>

<p class='c014'>The outrageousness of the conduct of Sir Giles is only to be
excused by the violence of his passions, and the turbulence of his
character. Mr. Kemble inverted this conception, and attempted to
reconcile the character, by softening down the action. He ‘aggravated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the part so, that he would seem like any sucking dove.’ For example,
nothing could exceed the coolness and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</span></i> with which he raps
Marall on the head with his cane, or spits at Lord Lovell: Lord
Foppington himself never did any common-place indecency more
insipidly. The only passage that pleased us, or that really called
forth the powers of the actor, was his reproach to Mr. Justice
Greedy: ‘There is some fury in that <i>Gut</i>.’ The indignity of the
word called up all the dignity of the actor to meet it, and he
guaranteed the word, though ‘a word of naught,’ according to the
letter and spirit of the convention between them, with a good grace,
in the true old English way. Either we mistake all Mr. Kemble’s
excellences, or they all disqualify him for this part. Sir Giles <i>hath
a devil</i>; Mr. Kemble has none. Sir Giles is in a passion; Mr.
Kemble is not. Sir Giles has no regard to appearances; Mr.
Kemble has. It has been said of the Venus de Medicis, ‘So stands
the statue that enchants the world;’ the same might have been said
of Mr. Kemble. He is the very still-life and statuary of the stage;
a perfect figure of a man; a petrifaction of sentiment, that heaves no
sigh, and sheds no tear; an icicle upon the bust of Tragedy. With
all his faults, he has powers and faculties which no one else on the
stage has; why then does he not avail himself of them, instead of
throwing himself upon the charity of criticism? Mr. Kemble has
given the public great, incalculable pleasure; and does he know so
little of the gratitude of the world as to trust to their generosity?</p>

<div class='c026'><i>May 19, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The new tragedy of Bertram at Drury-Lane Theatre has entirely
succeeded, and it has sufficient merit to deserve the success it has met
with. We had read it before we saw it, and it on the whole disappointed
us in the representation. Its beauties are rather those of
language and sentiment than of action or situation. The interest flags
very much during the last act, where the whole plot is known and
inevitable. What it has of stage-effect is scenic and extraneous, as
the view of the sea in a storm, the chorus of knights, &amp;c. instead of
arising out of the business of the play. We also object to the trick
of introducing the little child twice to untie the knot of the catastrophe.
One of these fantoccini exhibitions in the course of a
tragedy is quite enough.</p>

<p class='c014'>The general fault of this tragedy, and of other modern tragedies
that we could mention, is, that it is a tragedy without business.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Aristotle, we believe, defines tragedy to be the representation of
<i>a serious action</i>. Now here there is no action: there is neither cause
nor effect. There is a want of that necessary connection between
what happens, what is said, and what is done, in which we take the
essence of dramatic invention to consist. It is a sentimental drama,
it is a romantic drama, but it is not a tragedy, in the best sense of the
word. That is to say, the passion described does not arise naturally
out of the previous circumstances, nor lead necessarily to the consequences
that follow. Mere sentiment is voluntary, fantastic, self-created,
beginning and ending in itself; true passion is natural,
irresistible, produced by powerful causes, and impelling the will to
determinate actions. The old tragedy, if we understand it, is a
display of the affections of the heart and the energies of the will; the
modern romantic tragedy is a mixture of fanciful exaggeration and
indolent sensibility; the former is founded on real calamities and real
purposes: the latter courts distress, affects horror, indulges in all the
luxury of woe, and nurses its languid thoughts, and dainty sympathies,
to fill up the void of action. As the opera is filled with a sort of
singing people, who translate every thing into music, the modern
drama is filled with poets and their mistresses, who translate every
thing into metaphor and sentiment. Bertram falls under this censure.
It is a Winter’s Tale, a Midsummer Night’s Dream, but it is not
Lear or Macbeth. The poet does not describe what his characters
would feel in given circumstances, but lends them his own thoughts
and feelings out of his general reflections on human nature, or general
observation of certain objects. In a word, we hold for a truth, that
a thoroughly good tragedy is an impossibility in a state of manners
and literature where the poet and philosopher have got the better of
the man; where the reality does not mould the imagination, but the
imagination glosses over the reality; and where the unexpected stroke
of true calamity, the biting edge of true passion, is blunted, sheathed,
and lost, amidst the flowers of poetry strewed over unreal, unfelt
distress, and the flimsy topics of artificial humanity prepared beforehand
for all occasions. We are tired of this long-spun analysis; take
an example:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>This is very beautiful and affecting writing. The reader would
suppose that it related to events woven into the web of the history;
but no such thing. It is a purely voluntary or poetical fiction of
possible calamity, arising out of the experience of the author, not of
the heroine.</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole of the character of Clotilda, her confidante, who enters
immediately after, is superfluous. She merely serves for the heroine
to vent the moods of her own mind upon, and to break her enthusiastic
soliloquies into the appearance of a dialogue. There is no reason in
the world for the confidence thus reposed in Clotilda, with respect to
her love for the outlawed Bertram, but the eternal desire of talking.
Neither does she at all explain the grounds of her marriage to Aldobrand,
who her father was, or how his distresses induced her to
renounce her former lover. The whole is an effusion of tender
sentiments, sometimes very good and fine, but of which we neither
know the origin, the circumstances, nor the object; for her passion
for Bertram does not lead to any thing but the promise of an interview
to part for ever, which promise is itself broken. Among other fine
lines describing the situation of Imogine’s mind, are the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And yet some sorcery was wrought on me,</div>
      <div class='line'>For earlier things do seem as yesterday;</div>
      <div class='line'>But I’ve no recollection of the hour</div>
      <div class='line'>They gave my hand to Aldobrand.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps these lines would be more natural if spoken of the lady
than by her. The descriptive style will allow things to be supposed
or said of others, which cannot so well be believed or said by them.
There is also a want of dramatic decorum in Bertram’s description of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>a monastic life addressed to the Prior. It should be a solitary
reflection.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Yea, thus they live, if this may life be called,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where moving shadows mock the parts of men.</div>
      <div class='line'>Prayer follows study, study yields to prayer—</div>
      <div class='line'>Bell echoes bell, till wearied with the summons,</div>
      <div class='line'>The ear doth ache for that last welcome peal</div>
      <div class='line'>That tolls an end to listless vacancy.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>That part of the play where the chief interest should lie, namely, in
the scenes preceding the death of Aldobrand, is without any interest
at all, from the nature of the plot; for there is nothing left either to
hope or to fear; and not only is there no possibility of good, but
there is not even a choice of evils. The struggle of Imogine is a
mere alternation of senseless exclamations. Her declaring of her
husband, ‘By heaven and all its hosts, he shall not perish,’ is downright
rant. She has no power to prevent his death; she has no
power even to will his safety, for he is armed with what she deems
an unjust power over the life of Bertram, and the whole interest of
the play centres in her love for this Bertram. Opposite interests
destroy one another in the drama, like opposite forces in mechanics.
The situation of Belvidera in Venice Preserved, where the love to her
father or her husband must be sacrificed, is quite different, for she not
only hopes to reconcile them, but actually does reconcile them. The
speech of Bertram to the Knights after he has killed Aldobrand, and
his drawing off the dead body, to contemplate it alone, have been
much admired, and there is certainly something grand and impressive
in the first suggestion of the idea; but we do not believe it is in
nature. We will venture a conjecture, that it is formed on a false
analogy to two other ideas, viz. to that of a wild beast carrying off
its prey with it to its den, and to the story which Fuseli has painted,
of a man sitting over the corpse of his murdered wife. Now we can
conceive that a man might wish to feast his eyes on the dead body of
a person whom he had loved, and conceive that there was no one else
‘but they two left alone in the world,’ but not that any one would
have this feeling with respect to an enemy whom he had killed.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean as Bertram did several things finely; what we liked
most was his delivery of the speech, ‘The wretched have no country.’
Miss Somerville as Imogine was exceedingly interesting; she put us
in mind of Hogarth’s Sigismunda. She is tall and elegant, and her
face is good, with some irregularities. Her voice is powerful, and
her tones romantic. Her mode of repeating the line,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Th’ Elysian dreams of lovers, <i>when they loved</i>,’</div>

</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>had the true poetico-metaphysical cadence, as if the sound and the
sentiment would linger for ever on the ear. She might sit for the

<div class='c026'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>May 26, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A tragedy, to succeed, should be either uniformly excellent or
uniformly dull. Either will do almost equally well. We are convinced
that it would be possible to write a tragedy which should be a
tissue of unintelligible common-places from beginning to end, in which
not one word that is <i>said</i> shall be understood by the audience, and
yet, provided appearances are saved, and nothing is <i>done</i> to trip up
the heels of the imposture, it would go down. Adelaide, or the
Emigrants, is an instance in point. If there had been one good
passage in this play, it would infallibly have been damned. But it
was all of a piece; one absurdity justified another. The first scene
was like the second, the second act no worse than the first, the third
like the second, and so on to the end. The mind accommodates
itself to circumstances. The author never once roused the indignation
of his hearers by the disappointment of their expectations. He
startled the slumbering furies of the pit by no dangerous inequalities.
We were quite resigned by the middle of the third simile, and equally
thankful when the whole was over. The language of this tragedy is
made up of nonsense and indecency. Mixed metaphors abound in it.
The ‘torrent of passion rolls <i>along</i> precipices;’ pleasure is said to
gleam upon despair ‘like moss upon the desolate rock;’ the death of
a hero is compared to the peak of a mountain setting in seas of glory,
or some such dreadful simile, built up with ladders and scaffolding.
Then the thunder and lightning are mingled with bursts of fury and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>revenge in inextricable confusion; there are such unmeaning phrases
as <i>contagious gentleness</i>, and the heroes and the heroine, in their
transports, as a common practice, set both worlds at defiance.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plot of this play is bad, for it is unintelligible in a great
measure, and where it is not unintelligible, absurd. Count Lunenburg
cannot marry Adelaide because ‘his Emperor’s frown’ has forbidden
his marriage with the daughter of an Emigrant Nobleman; and so,
to avoid this imperial frown, he betrays her into a pretended marriage,
and thus intends to divide his time between war and a mistress.
Hence all the distress and mischiefs which ensue; and though the
morality of the affair is characteristic enough of the old school, yet
neither the Emperor’s frown nor the Count’s levity seem sufficient
reasons for harrowing up the feelings in the manner proposed by the
author, and plunging us into the horrors of the French Revolution at
the same time. The exiled St. Evremond saw ‘his lawful monarch’s
bleeding head, and yet he prayed;’ he saw ‘his castle walls crumbled
into ashes by the devouring flames, and yet he prayed:’ but when he
finds his daughter betrayed by one of his legitimate friends, he can
‘pray no more.’ His wife, the Countess, takes some comfort, and
she builds her hope on a word, which, she says, is of great virtue, the
word, ‘perhaps.’ ‘It is the word which the slave utters as he stands
upon the western shores, and looks towards Afric’s climes—<i>Perhaps</i>!’—Of
the attention paid to costume, some idea may be formed by the
circumstance, that in the church-yard where the catastrophe takes
place, the inscriptions on the tomb-stones are all in German, though
the people speak English. The rest is in the same style. The
<i>Emigrants</i> is a political attempt to drench an English audience with
French loyalty: now, French loyalty to the House of Bourbon, is a
thing as little to our taste as Scotch loyalty to the House of Stuart;
and when we find our political quacks preparing to pour their nauseous
trash with false labels down our throats, we must ‘throw it to the
dogs: we’ll none of it.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Young, as the injured Count, raved without meaning, and
grew light-headed with great deliberation. Charles Kemble, in
tragedy, only spoils a good face. Mr. Murray, as the old servant
of the family, was ‘as good as a prologue,’ and his helpless horror at
what is going forward exceedingly amusing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Miss O’Neill’s Adelaide, which we suppose was intended to be
the chief attraction of the piece, was to us the most unpleasant part of
it. She has powers which ought not to be thrown away, and yet she
trifles with them. She wastes them equally on genteel comedy and
vulgar tragedy. Her acting in Adelaide, which in other circumstances
might have been impressive, was to us repulsive. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>agonizing passion she expressed, required that our feelings should be
wound up to the highest pitch, either by the imagination of the poet
or the interest of the story, to meet it on equal terms. We are not
in an ordinary mood prepared for the shrieks of mandrakes, for the
rattles in the throat, for looks that drive the thoughts to madness.
Miss O’Neill’s acting is pure nature or passion: it is the prose of
tragedy; for the poetry she must lean on her author. But strong
passion must be invested with imagination by some one, either by the
poet or the actor, before it can give delight, not to say, before it can
be endured by the public. Her manner in the scene where she asks
Lunenberg about her marriage, was much the same as when Monimia
asks Polydore, ‘Where did you rest last night?’ Yet how different
was the effect! in the one, her frantic eagerness only corresponded
with the interest already excited; in the other, it shocked, because
no interest had been excited. Miss O’Neill fills better than any one
else the part assigned her by the author, but she does not <i>make</i> it, nor
over-inform it with qualities which she is not bound to bring. She
is, therefore, more dependent than any one else upon the character
she has to represent; and as she originally owes her reputation to
her powers of sensibility, she will perhaps owe its ultimate continuance
to the cultivation of her taste in the choice of the characters in which
she appears. The public are jealous of their favourites!</p>

<h3 class='c008'>EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR</h3>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>June 9, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Kean had for his benefit at Drury-Lane Theatre, on Wednesday,
the Comedy of Every Man in his Humour. This play acts
much better than it reads. It has been observed of Ben Jonson,
that he painted not so much human nature as temporary manners, not
the characters of men, but their <i>humours</i>, that is to say, peculiarities
of phrase, modes of dress, gesture, &amp;c. which becoming obsolete, and
being in themselves altogether arbitrary and fantastical, have become
unintelligible and uninteresting. Brainworm is a particularly dry and
abstruse character. We neither know his business nor his motives;
his plots are as intricate as they are useless, and as the ignorance of
those he imposes upon is wonderful. This is the impression in
reading it. Yet from the bustle and activity of this character on the
stage, the changes of dress, the variety of affected tones and gipsey
jargon, and the limping, distorted gestures, it is a very amusing
exhibition, as Mr. Munden plays it. Bobadil is the only actually
striking character in the play, or which tells equally in the closet and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the theatre. The rest, Master Matthew, Master Stephen, Cob and
Cob’s Wife, were living in the sixteenth century. But from the very
oddity of their appearance and behaviour, they have a very droll and
even picturesque effect when acted. It seems a revival of the dead.
We believe in their existence when we see them. As an example of
the power of the stage in giving reality and interest to what otherwise
would be without it, we might mention the scene in which Brainworm
praises Master Stephen’s leg. The folly here is insipid, from its
seeming carried to an excess,—till we see it; and then we laugh the
more at it, the more incredible we thought it before.</p>

<p class='c014'>The pathos in the principal character, Kitely, is ‘as dry as the
remainder biscuit after a voyage.’ There is, however, a certain good
sense, discrimination, or <i>logic of passion</i> in the part, which Mr. Kean
pointed in such a way as to give considerable force to it. In the
scene where he is about to confide the secret of his jealousy to his
servant, Thomas, he was exceedingly happy in the working himself
up to the execution of his design, and in the repeated failure of his
resolution. The reconciliation-scene with his wife had great spirit,
where he tells her, to shew his confidence, that ‘she may sing, may
go to balls, may dance,’ and the interruption of this sudden tide of
concession with the restriction—‘though I had rather you did not do
all this’—was a master-stroke. It was perhaps the first time a
parenthesis was ever spoken on the stage as it ought to be. Mr. Kean
certainly often repeats this artifice of abrupt transition in the tones in
which he expresses different passions, and still it always pleases,—we
suppose, because it is natural. This gentleman is not only a good
actor in himself, but he is the cause of good acting in others. The
whole play was got up very effectually. Considerable praise is due
to the industry and talent shewn by Mr. Harley, in Captain Bobadil.
He did his best in it, and that was not ill. He delivered the
Captain’s well-known proposal for the pacification of Europe, by
killing twenty of them each his man a day, with good emphasis and
discretion. Bobadil is undoubtedly the hero of the piece; his extravagant
affectation carries the sympathy of the audience along with it,
and his final defeat and exposure, though exceedingly humorous, is
the only affecting circumstance in the play. Mr. Harley’s fault in
this and other characters is, that he too frequently assumes mechanical
expressions of countenance and bye-tones of humour, which have not
any thing to do with the individual part. Mr. Hughes personified
Master Matthew to the life: he appeared ‘like a man made after
supper of a cheese-paring.’ Munden did Brainworm with laudable
alacrity. Oxberry’s Master Stephen was very happily hit off;
nobody plays the traditional fool of the English stage so well; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>seems not only foolish, but fond of folly. The two young gentlemen,
Master Well-bred and Master Edward Knowell, were the only
insipid characters.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>June 16, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>Players should be immortal, if their own wishes or ours could make
them so; but they are not. They not only die like other people,
but like other people they cease to be young, and are no longer themselves,
even while living. Their health, strength, beauty, voice, fails
them; nor can they, without these advantages, perform the same
feats, or command the same applause that they did when possessed of
them. It is the common lot: players are only <i>not</i> exempt from it.
Mrs. Siddons retired once from the stage: why should she return to
it again? She cannot retire from it twice with dignity; and yet it
is to be wished that she should do all things with dignity. Any loss
of reputation to her, is a loss to the world. Has she not had enough
of glory? The homage she has received is greater than that which
is paid to Queens. The enthusiasm she excited had something
idolatrous about it; she was regarded less with admiration than with
wonder, as if a being of a superior order had dropped from another
sphere to awe the world with the majesty of her appearance. She
raised Tragedy to the skies, or brought it down from thence. It
was something above nature. We can conceive of nothing grander.
She embodied to our imagination the fables of mythology, of the
heroic and deified mortals of elder time. She was not less than a
goddess, or than a prophetess inspired by the gods. Power was
seated on her brow, passion emanated from her breast as from a shrine.
She was Tragedy personified. She was the stateliest ornament of
the public mind. She was not only the idol of the people, she not
only hushed the tumultuous shouts of the pit in breathless expectation,
and quenched the blaze of surrounding beauty in silent tears,
but to the retired and lonely student, through long years of solitude,
her face has shone as if an eye had appeared from heaven; her name
has been as if a voice had opened the chambers of the human heart,
or as if a trumpet had awakened the sleeping and the dead. To have
seen Mrs. Siddons, was an event in every one’s life; and does she
think we have forgot her? Or would she remind us of herself by
shewing us what <i>she was not</i>? Or is she to continue on the stage to
the very last, till all her grace and all her grandeur gone, shall leave
behind them only a melancholy blank? Or is she merely to be
played off as ‘the baby of a girl’ for a few nights?—‘Rather than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>so,’ come, Genius of Gil Blas, thou that didst inspire him in an evil
hour to perform his promise to the Archbishop of Grenada, ‘and
champion us to the utterance’ of what we think on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is said that the Princess Charlotte has expressed a desire to
see Mrs. Siddons in her best parts, and this, it is said, is a thing
highly desirable. We do not know that the Princess has expressed
any such wish, and we shall suppose that she has not, because we do
not think it altogether a reasonable one. If the Princess Charlotte
had expressed a wish to see Mr. Garrick, this would have been a
thing highly desirable, but it would have been impossible; or if she
had desired to see Mrs. Siddons <i>in her best days</i>, it would have been
equally so; and yet without this, we do not think it desirable that
she should see her at all. It is said to be desirable that a Princess
should have a taste for the Fine Arts, and that this is best promoted
by seeing the highest models of perfection. But it is of the first
importance for Princes to acquire a taste for what is reasonable: and
the second thing which it is desirable they should acquire, is a
deference to public opinion: and we think neither of these objects
likely to be promoted in the way proposed. If it was reasonable
that Mrs. Siddons should retire from the stage three years ago,
certainly those reasons have not diminished since, nor do we think
Mrs. Siddons would consult what is due to her powers or her fame,
in commencing a new career. If it is only intended that she should
act a few nights in the presence of a particular person, this might be
done as well in private. To all other applications she should answer—‘Leave
me to my repose.’</p>

<p class='c014'>Mrs. Siddons always spoke as slow as she ought: she now speaks
slower than she did. ‘The line too labours, and the words move
slow.’ The machinery of the voice seems too ponderous for the
power that wields it. There is too long a pause between each
sentence, and between each word in each sentence. There is too
much preparation. The stage waits for her. In the sleeping scene,
she produced a different impression from what we expected. It was
more laboured, and less natural. In coming on formerly, her eyes
were open, but the sense was shut. She was like a person bewildered,
and unconscious of what she did. She moved her lips involuntarily;
all her gestures were involuntary and mechanical. At present she
acts the part more with a view to effect. She repeats the action
when she says, ‘I tell you he cannot rise from his grave,’ with both
hands sawing the air, in the style of parliamentary oratory, the worst
of all others. There was none of this weight or energy in the way
she did the scene the first time we saw her, twenty years ago. She
glided on and off the stage almost like an apparition. In the close of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>the banquet scene, Mrs. Siddons condescended to an imitation which
we were sorry for. She said, ‘Go, go,’ in the hurried familiar tone
of common life, in the manner of Mr. Kean, and without any of that
sustained and graceful spirit of conciliation towards her guests, which
used to characterise her mode of doing it. Lastly, if Mrs. Siddons
has to leave the stage again, Mr. Horace Twiss will write another
farewell address for her: if she continues on it, we shall have to
criticise her performances. We know which of these two evils we
shall think the greatest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Too much praise cannot be given to Mr. Kemble’s performance of
Macbeth. He was ‘himself again,’ and more than himself. His
action was decided, his voice audible. His tones had occasionally
indeed a learned quaintness, like the colouring of Poussin; but the
effect of the whole was fine. His action in delivering the speech,
‘To-morrow and to-morrow,’ was particularly striking and expressive,
as if he had stumbled by an accident on fate, and was baffled by the
impenetrable obscurity of the future.—In that prodigious prosing
paper, the Times, which seems to be written as well as printed by a
steam-engine, Mr. Kemble is compared to the ruin of a magnificent
temple, in which the divinity still resides. This is not the case.
The temple is unimpaired; but the divinity is sometimes from home.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>June 23, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The New English Opera-House (late the Lyceum Theatre) in the
Strand, opened on Saturday week. The carpenters are but just got
out of it; and in our opinion they have made but an indifferent piece
of work of it. It consists of lobbies and vacant spaces. The three
tiers of boxes are raised so high above one another, that the house
would look empty even if it were full, and at present it is not full, but
empty. The second gallery, for fear of its crowding on the first, is
thrown back to such an unconscionable height, that it seems like a
balcony projecting from some other building, where the spectators do
not pay for peeping. All this no doubt promotes the circulation of
air, and keeps the Theatre cool and comfortable. Mr. Arnold’s
philosophy may be right, but our prejudices are strongly against it.
Our notions of a summer theatre are, that it should look <i>smoking hot</i>,
and feel more like a warm bath than a well. We like to see a
summer theatre as crowded as a winter one, so that a breath of air is
a luxury. We like to see the well-dressed company in the boxes
languidly silent, and to hear the Gods noisy and quarrelling for want
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of room and breath—the cries of ‘Throw him over!’ becoming
more loud and frequent as the weather gets farther on into the dog-days.
We like all this, because we are used to it, and are as
obstinately attached to old abuses in matters of amusement, as kings,
judges, and legislators are in state affairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>The New Theatre opened with Up all Night, or the Smugglers’
Cave; a piece admirably well adapted as a succedaneum for keeping
the house cool and airy. The third night there was nobody there.
To say the truth, we never saw a duller performance. The Actors
whom the Manager has got together, are both new and strange.
They are most of them recruits from the country, and of that
description which is known by the vulgar appellation of the <i>awkward
squad</i>. Mr. Russell (from Edinburgh, not our old friend Jerry
Sneak) is the only one amongst them who understands his exercise.
Mr. Short and Mr. Isaacs are singers, and we fear not good ones.
Mr. Short has white teeth, and Mr. Isaacs black eyes. We do not
like the name of Mr. Huckel. There is also a Mrs. Henley, who
plays the fat Landlady in the Beehive, of the size of life.—Mr.
Lancaster, who played Filch in the Beggars’ Opera, and Mrs. W.
Penson, who played the part of Lucy Lockitt tolerably, and looked
it intolerably well. There is also Mr. Bartley, who is Stage-manager,
and who threatens to be very prominent this season. There
is also, from the old corps, Wrench, the easiest of actors; and there
is Fanny Kelly, who after all, is not herself a whole company.
We miss little Knight, and several other of our summer friends.</p>

<p class='c018'><i>The Winter Theatres.</i>—We must, we suppose, for the present, take
our leave of the winter performances. We lately saw at Covent-Garden
Mr. Emery’s Robert Tyke, in the School of Reform, of
which we had heard a good deal, and which fully justified all that
we had heard of its excellence. It is one of the most natural and
powerful pieces of acting on the stage; it is the sublime of low
tragedy. We should like to see any body do it better. The scene
where, being brought before Lord Avondale as a robber, he discovers
him to have been formerly an accomplice in villainy; that in
which he gives an account of the death of his father, and goes off the
stage calling for ‘Brandy, brandy!’ and that in which he finds this
same father, whom he had supposed dead, alive again, are, in our
judgment, master-pieces both of pathos and grandeur. We do not
think all excellence is confined to walking upon stilts. We conceive
that Mr. Emery shewed about as much genius in this part, which he
performed for his benefit, as Mr. Liston did afterwards in singing the
song of Ti, tum, ti; we cannot say more of it. Genius appears to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>us to be a very <i>unclassical</i> quality. There is but a little of it in the
world, but what there is, is always unlike itself and every thing else.
Your imitators of the tragic, epic, and grand style, may be multiplied
to any extent, as we raise regiments of grenadiers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mrs. Mardyn, after an absence of some weeks, has appeared again
at Drury-Lane, in the new part of the Irish Widow, the charming
Widow Brady; and a most delightful representative she made of her—full
of life and spirit, well-made, handsome, and good-natured.
If it is a fault to be handsome, Mrs. Mardyn certainly deserves to be
hissed off the stage.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE JEALOUS WIFE</h3>

</div>

<div class='c026'><i>June 30, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>The performances at Drury-Lane Theatre closed for the season on
Friday evening last, with the Jealous Wife, Sylvester Daggerwood,
and the Mayor of Garratt. After the play Mr. Rae came forward,
and in a neat address, not ill delivered, returned thanks to the public,
in the name of the Managers and Performers, for the success with
which their endeavours to afford rational amusement and to sustain
the legitimate drama, had been attended.</p>

<p class='c014'>The play-bills had announced Mrs. Davison for the part of
Mrs. Oakley, in the Jealous Wife. We have seen nothing of this
Lady of late, except when she personated the Comic Muse (for
one night only), on the second centenary of Shakespear’s death.
The glimpses we catch of her are, in one sense,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like angels’ visits, short, and far between.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>She was absent on the present occasion, and Mrs. Glover took
the part of the well-drawn heroine of Colman’s amusing and very
instructive comedy. Mrs. Glover was not quite at home in the
part. She represented the passions of the woman, but not the
manners of the fine lady. She succeeds best in grave or violent
parts, and has very little of the playful or delicate in her acting.
If we were to hazard a general epithet for her style of performing,
we should say that it amounts to the <i>formidable</i>; her expression of
passion is too hysterical, and habitually reminds one of hartshorn
and water. On great occasions she displays the fury of a lioness
who has lost her young, and in playing a queen or princess, deluges
the theatre with her voice. Her Quaker in Wild Oats, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>contrary, is an inimitable piece of quiet acting. The demureness
of the character, which takes away all temptation to be boisterous,
leaves the justness of her conception in full force: and the simplicity
of her Quaker dress is most agreeably relieved by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</span></i> of
her person.</p>

<p class='c014'>The comedy of the Jealous Wife was not upon the whole so well
cast here as at Covent-Garden. Munden’s Sir Harry Beagle was
not to our taste. It was vulgarity in double-heaped measure. The
part itself is a gross caricature, and Munden’s playing caricature is
something like <i>carrying coals to Newcastle</i>. Russell’s Lord Trinket
was also a failure: he can only play a modern jockey Nobleman:
Lord Trinket is a fop of the old school.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Harley played Sylvester Daggerwood, in the entertainment
which followed, well enough to make us regret our old favourite
Bannister, and attempted some imitations, (one of Matthews in
particular) which were pleasant and lively, but not very like.</p>

<p class='c014'>The acting of Dowton and Russell, in Major Sturgeon and Jerry
Sneak, is well known to our readers: at least we would advise all
those who have not seen it, to go and see this perfect exhibition of
comic talent. The strut, the bluster, the hollow swaggering, and
turkey-cock swell of the Major, and Jerry’s meekness, meanness,
folly, good-nature, and hen-pecked air, are assuredly done to the
life. The latter character is even better than the former, which is
saying a bold word. Dowton’s art is only an imitation of art, of an
affected or assumed character; but in Russell’s Jerry you see the
very soul of nature, in a fellow that is ‘pigeon livered and lacks
gall,’ laid open and anatomized. You can see that his heart is no
bigger than a pin, and his head as soft as a pippin. His whole
aspect is chilled and frightened as if he had been dipped in a pond,
and yet he looks as if he would like to be snug and comfortable,
if he durst. He smiles as if he would be friends with you upon
any terms; and the tears come in his eyes because you will not let
him. The tones of his voice are prophetic as the cuckoo’s undersong.
His words are made of water-gruel. The scene in which he
tries to make a confidant of the Major is great; and his song of
‘Robinson Crusoe’ as melancholy as the Island itself. The
reconciliation-scene with his wife, and his exclamation over her,
‘to think that I should make my Molly <i>veep</i>,’ are pathetic, if the
last stage of human infirmity is so. This farce appears to us to be
both moral and entertaining; yet it does not take. It is considered
as an unjust satire on the city and the country at large, and there
is a very frequent repetition of the word ‘nonsense,’ in the house
during the performance. Mr. Dowton was even hissed, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>from the upper boxes or gallery, in his speech recounting the
marching of his corps ‘from Brentford to Ealing, and from Ealing
to Acton;’ and several persons in the pit, who thought the whole
<i>low</i>, were for going out. This shews well for the progress of
civilisation. We suppose the manners described in the Mayor of
Garratt have in the last forty years become obsolete, and the
characters ideal: we have no longer either hen-pecked or brutal
husbands, or domineering wives; the Miss Molly Jollops no longer
wed Jerry Sneaks, or admire the brave Major Sturgeons on the
other side of Temple Bar; all our soldiers have become heroes, and
our magistrates respectable, and the farce of life is o’er!</p>

<div class='c026'><i>July 7, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We are glad to find the Haymarket Theatre re-opened with some
good actors from the Winter Theatres, besides recruits. On
Monday was played the Man of the World, Sir Pertinax MacSycophant
by Mr. Terry. This part was lately performed by
Mr. Bibby at Covent-Garden without success; and we apprehend
that his failure was owing to the extreme purity and breadth of his
Scotch accent. Mr. Terry avoided splitting on this rock, by sinking
the Scotch brogue almost entirely, and thus this national caricature
was softened into a more general and less offensive portrait of a
common Man of the World. On the whole, Mr. Terry gave not
only less of the costume and local colouring of the character, but
less of the general force and spirit than the former gentleman. He
however displayed his usual judgment and attention to his part, with
less appearance of effort than he sometimes shews. If Mr. Terry
would take rather less pains, he would be a better actor. He is
exceedingly correct in the conception of his characters, but in the
execution he often takes twice the time in bringing out his words
that he ought, and lays double the emphasis on them that is necessary.
In the present case, Mr. Terry, probably from feeling no great liking
to his part, laid less stress on particular passages, and was more happy
on that account. The scene in which he gives the account of his
progress in life to his son Egerton, was one of the most effectual.
Mrs. Glover’s Lady Rodolpha Lumbercourt had considerable spirit
and archness, as well as force. Of the new performers in it we
cannot speak very favourably. The young gentleman who played
Sydney, a Mr. Baker, seems really a clergyman by profession, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>to have left, rather imprudently, the prospect of a fellowship at
Oxford or Cambridge. His voice and cadences are good; but they
are fitter for the pulpit than the stage.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mr. Watkinson, on Thursday played Sir Robert Bramble, in the
Poor Gentleman, with a considerable share of that blunt native
humour, and rustic gentility, which distinguish so large a class of
characters on the English stage. We mean that sort of characters
who usually appear in a brown bob-wig, and chocolate-coloured
coat, with brass buttons. Of this class Mr. Watkinson, as far as
we could judge on a first acquaintance, appears to be a very respectable,
if not brilliant representative. A Miss Taylor made an elegant
and interesting Emily, the daughter of the Poor Gentleman; and
Mr. Foote played that personification of modern humanity, the Poor
Gentleman himself. There is a tone of recitation in this actor’s
delivery, perhaps not ill suited to the whining sentimentality of the
parts he has to play, but which is very tiresome to the ear. We
might say to him as Caesar did to some one, ‘Do you read or sing?
If you sing, you sing very ill.’ We must not omit to mention the
part of Miss Lætitia Macnab, which was performed to the life by
a Mrs. Kennedy of Covent-Garden Theatre, whom we never saw
here before, but whom we shall certainly remember. Her hoop-petticoats,
flying lappets, high head-dress, face, voice, and figure,
reminded us but too well of that obsolete class of antiquated maidens
of old families that flourished about fifty years ago, who had no
idea of any thing but the self-importance which they derived from
their ancestors, and of the personal attractions which were to be
found in the ridiculousness of their dress. The effect was as
surprising as it was painful. It was as if Miss Macnab had
come in person from the grave. It was like the restoration of the
Bourbons!</p>

<p class='c014'>After this melancholy casualty, we had the Agreeable Surprise.
Mrs. Gibbs played Cowslip delightfully. Fawcett was exceedingly
laughable in Lingo; and would have been more so, if he had played
it with more gravity. Fawcett’s fault of late is, that he has not
respect enough for his art. This is a pity; for his art is a very
good art. At the scene between him and Mrs. Cheshire, (Mrs.
Davenport), the house was in a roar. We never knew before that
Lingo and Cowslip were descendants of Touchstone and Audrey.
This is one of O’Keeffe’s best farces, and his farces are the best in
the world except Moliere’s. O’Keeffe is (for he is still living)
our English Moliere, and we here return him our most hearty thanks
for all the hearty laughing he has given us. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est un bon garçon.</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>There are in the Agreeable Surprise some of the most irresistible
<i>double entendres</i> that can be conceived, and in Lingo’s superb replication,
‘A scholar! I was a master of scholars!’ he has hit the height
of the ridiculous.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>MISS MERRY’S MANDANE</h3>

<div class='lg-container-l c004'>

  </div>
</div>

<div class='c026'><i>July 21, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>A young lady whose name is Miss Merry, has appeared with great
applause in the part of Mandane, in Artaxerxes, at the New English
Opera. Miss Merry is not tall, but there is something not ungraceful
in her person: her face, without being regular, has a pleasing expression
in it; her action is good, and often spirited; and her voice is excellent.
The songs she has to sing in this character are delightful, and she
sung them very delightfully. Her timidity on the first night of her
appearing was so great, as almost to prevent her from going on. But
her apprehensions, though they lessened the power of her voice, did
not take from its sweetness. She appears to possess very great taste
and skill; and to have not only a fine voice, but (what many singers
want) an ear for music. Her tones are mellow, true, and varied;
sometimes exquisitely broken by light, fluttering half-notes—at other
times reposing on a deep-murmuring bass. The general style of her
singing is equable, and unaffected; yet in one or two passages, we
thought she added some extraneous and unnecessary ornaments, and
(for a precious note or two) lost the charm of the expression, by
sacrificing simplicity to execution. This objection struck us most in
the manner in which Miss Merry sung the beautiful air, ‘If o’er the
cruel tyrant Love,’ which is an irresistible appeal to the sentiments,
and seems, in its genuine simplicity, above all art. This song, and
particularly the last lines, ‘What was my pride, is now my shame,’
&amp;c. ought to be sung, as we have heard them sung, as if the notes
fell from her lips like the liquid drops from the bending flower, and
her voice fluttered and died away with the expiring conflict of passion
in her bosom. If vocal music has an advantage over instrumental,
it is, we imagine, in this very particular; in the immediate communication
between the words and the expression they suggest, between the
voice and the soul of the singer, which ought to mould every tone,
whether deep or tender, according to the impulse of true passion.
Miss Merry’s execution does not rest entirely upon the ground of
expression: she is not always thinking of the subject. Her ‘Soldier
tired,’ and ‘Let not rage thy bosom firing,’ were both admirable.
Her voice has not the piercing softness of Miss Stephens’s, its clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>crystalline qualities. Neither has her style of singing the same
originality, and simple pathos. Miss Stephens’s voice and manner
are her own: Miss Merry belongs to a class of singers, but that class
is a very pleasing one, and she is at present at the head of it. She is
an undoubted acquisition both to the New English Opera, and to the
English stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Horn’s Arbaces was very fine. He sings always in tune, and
in an admirable <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">sostenuto</span></i> style. He keeps his voice (perhaps indeed)
too much under him, and does not let it loose often enough. His
manner of singing ‘Water parted from the sea’ was of this internal
and suppressed character. Though this may be the feeling suggested
by part of the words, yet certainly in other parts the voice ought to
be thrown out, and as it were, go a journey, like the water’s course.
Of the other performers we can say nothing favourable.</p>

<div class='c026'><i>July 28, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c014'>We insert the following letter, which has been sent us, merely to
show our impartiality:</p>

<p class='c024'>‘<span class='sc'>Mr. Editor</span>,—I have been to see the new Comedy Exit by Mistake,
at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. As this piece is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans</span></i> moral and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans</span></i>
interest, I am surprised at its being called a <i>Comedy</i>, for many of our old
<i>Farces</i> are more worthy of the name. Perhaps the author fondly anticipated
much pathos from Mrs. Kendal’s scene with her son (Mr. Barnard), but
it would have been much better if both mother and son had been omitted,
for the latter is a hot-headed blockhead, who commits a most unjustifiable
assault upon a <i>stranger</i>, in a <i>stranger’s</i> house, by turning him out, which
gross affront is in the last Act overlooked. In consequence of a letter
about Mr. Roland’s departure, accompanied by his will, it is supposed he
had departed from the <i>world</i> instead of the <i>country</i> where he was. This is
the ‘<cite>Exit by Mistake</cite>,’ but the chief mistakes arise from the <i>entrances</i> of
the performers. The executor hearing that Roland (Mr. Terry) is alive
and in town, goes to an inn to meet him, but most unaccountably mistakes
Mr. Rattletrap (Russel) an actor just arrived from America, for his own
friend, and even calls the actor by the name of Rattletrap. Poor Mr. Roland,
in order to recover his property, inquires for an attorney, and is told there’s
one <i>below</i>. Soon after the executor enters, and though dressed in a <i>brown</i>
coat, he is mistaken for an attorney. There are other inferior mistakes in
the piece, but the greatest mistake is the author’s—for it is a Farce instead
of a Comedy. As the play-bills state, that this piece has since been
applauded by ‘brilliant and crowded audiences,’ and that ‘no orders can
be admitted;’ the proprietors have no right to complain of their rival, the
Lyceum Theatre, except Mr. Arnold should produce a good Opera to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>oppose this Farcical Comedy, and then the public will see the utility of
rival theatres. Mr. Tokely’s character in it (Crockery) is the same which
the same gentleman performs in the author’s ‘Love and Gout,’ with this
difference, that in one he is a dissatisfied gentleman, and in the other a
whining servant. Mr. Jones’s character (Restless Absent) keeps him in
motion the first two Acts, but in the last he is quite stationary.</p>

<div class='c019'>‘<span class='sc'>Dramaticus.</span></div>

<div class='lg-container-l c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<i>July 25, 1816.</i>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>We do not agree with Dramaticus on the subject of the piece,
which he so resolutely condemns. He puts us a little (though not
much) in mind of John Dennis, who drew his sword on the author
of a successful tragedy, without any other provocation. As to the
title of this play, to which our critic so vehemently objects, we leave
him to settle that point with the author. We do not judge of plays,
or of any thing else by their titles.</p>

<p class='c021'>The writer says, the Proprietors of the Haymarket have no right
to complain, ‘except Mr. Arnold should produce a good Opera to
oppose this Farcical Comedy, and then the public will see the utility
of rival theatres.’ We wish Mr. Arnold would lose no time in
convincing the public. As we have not the same faith as our
correspondent in the power of rival theatres in screwing up the
wits of their opponents, we did not go to the new comedy of Exit
by Mistake, expecting either a profound moral or high interest;
and so far we were not disappointed. But with a good deal of
absurdity, there is some whim in it: there are several very tolerable
puns in it, and a sufficient stock of lively passing allusions. It is
light and laughable, and does well enough for a summer theatre.
The part of Crockery in particular is very droll, and to us quite
new, for we are not acquainted with ‘the dissatisfied gentleman,’
his predecessor, in Love and Gout. Crockery is a foolish fat
servant (personated exceedingly well by Mr. Tokely) who complains
that every thing is altered since he went abroad with his master,
‘cries all the way from Portsmouth, because the mile-stones are
changed, and is in despair because an old pigstye has been converted
into a dwelling-house.’ This whimpering, maudlin philosopher, is
as tenacious of innovation as the late Mr. Burke, and as great an
admirer of <i>the good old times</i>, as the editor of a modern Journal.
In one thing we agree with honest Crockery, where he does not
like to see the sign of the Duke of Marlborough’s head pulled down
for the Duke of Wellington’s; in the first place, because the Duke
of Marlborough had a very good head, and the Duke of Wellington’s
is a mere sign-post; in the second, because we think it a more
meritorious act to drive out the English Bourbons, the Stuarts, than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>to restore the French Stuarts, the Bourbons, to the throne of <i>their</i>
ancestors. So much for the politics of the Theatre.</p>

<p class='c028'>There is another new piece, A Man in Mourning for Himself,
come out at the new English Theatre, which, whether it is Comedy,
Opera, or Farce, we do not know. But—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de mortuis nil nisi bonum</span></i>.
So let it pass. But there is a Mr. Herring in it, whom we cannot pass
by without notice. He is the oddest fish that has lately been landed
on the stage. We are to thank Mr. Arnold for bringing him ashore.
This <i>did</i> require some sagacity, some discrimination. We never saw
any thing more amphibious,—with coat-pockets in the shape of fins,
and a jowl like gills with the hook just taken out. He flounders and
flounces upon the stage with the airs and genius of a Dutch plaise.
His person detonates with boisterous wit and humour, and his voice
goes off like a cracker near a sounding-board. With these preparatory
qualifications, he played a valet who is his own master; and the
jumble of high life below stairs was very complete. This gentleman’s
gentleman was very coarse and very mawkish; very blustering and
very sheepish; and runs his head into scrapes without the slightest
suspicion. We have never seen Mr. Herring before; but on this
occasion he was, according to our tastes, in fine pickle and
preservation.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Beggar’s Opera was performed on Thursday, when Miss
Merry appeared in the part of Polly, and Mr. Horn as Captain
Macheath. Miss Merry displayed great sweetness and taste in most
of the songs, and her acting was pleasing, though she laboured under
considerable embarrassment. We liked her ‘Ponder well,’ and ‘My
all’s in my possession,’ the best. She seemed to us not to be quite
perfect either in ‘Cease your funning,’ or in the exquisite little air of
‘He so teased me.’ We have no doubt, however, that she will make
in time a very interesting representative of one of the most interesting
characters on the stage, for we hardly know any character more
artless and amiable than Gay’s Polly, except perhaps Shakespear’s
Imogen. And Polly has the advantage on the stage, for she <i>may be
sung</i>, but Imogen cannot be <i>acted</i>.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Horn’s Macheath was much better than what we have lately
seen. He sung the songs well, with a little too much ornament for
the profession of the Captain: and his air and manner, though they
did not fall into the common error of vulgarity, were rather too
precise and finical. Macheath should be a fine man and a gentleman,
but he should be one of God Almighty’s gentlemen, not a gentleman
of the black rod. His gallantry and good-breeding should arise from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>impulse, not from rule; not from the trammels of education, but from
a soul generous, courageous, good-natured, aspiring, amorous. The
class of the character is very difficult to hit. It is something between
gusto and slang, like port-wine and brandy mixed. It is not the
mere gentleman that should be represented, but the blackguard
sublimated into the gentleman. This character is qualified in a
highwayman, as it is qualified in a prince. We hope this is not
a libel. Miss Kelly’s Lucy was excellent. She is worthy to

<div class='c019'>(<i>King’s Theatre</i>) <i>August 4, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>In Schlegel’s work on the Drama, there are the following remarks
on the nature of the Opera:</p>

<p class='c021'>‘In Tragedy the chief object is the poetry, and every other thing
is subordinate to it; but in the Opera, the poetry is merely an
accessary, the means of connecting the different parts together, and it
is almost buried under its associates. The best prescription for the
composition of the text of an Opera is to give a poetical sketch,
which may be afterwards filled up and coloured by the other arts.
This anarchy of the arts, where music, dancing, and decoration
endeavour to surpass each other by the most profuse display of
dazzling charms, constitutes the very essence of the Opera. What
sort of opera music would it be, where the words should receive a
mere rhythmical accompaniment of the simplest modulations? The
fantastic magic of the Opera consists altogether in the luxurious
competition of the different means, and in the perplexity of an overflowing
superfluity. This would at once be destroyed by an approximation
to the severity of the ancient taste in any one point, even in
that of costume; for the contrast would render the variety in all the
other departments quite insupportable. The costume of the Opera
ought to be dazzling, and overladen with ornaments; and hence many
things which have been censured as unnatural, such as exhibiting
heroes warbling and trilling in the excess of despondency, are
perfectly justifiable. This fairy world is not peopled by real men,
but by a singular kind of singing creatures. Neither is it any disadvantage
to us, that the Opera is conveyed in a language which is
not generally understood; the text is altogether lost in the music, and
the language, the most harmonious and musical, and which contains
the greatest number of open vowels and distinct accents for recitative,
is therefore the best.’</p>

<p class='c021'>The foregoing remarks give the best account we have seen of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>splendid exhibition, the Italian Opera. These German critics can
explain every thing, and upon any given occasion, <i>make the worse
appear the better reason</i>. Their theories are always at variance with
common sense, and we shall not in the present instance, undertake to
decide between them. There is one thing, however, which we will
venture to decide, which is, that the feelings of the English people
must undergo some very elaborate process (metaphysical or practical)
before they are thoroughly reconciled to this union of different
elements, the consistency and harmony of which depends on their
contradiction and discord. We take it, the English are so far from
being an opera-going, that they are not even a play-going people, from
constitution. You can hardly get them to speak their sentiments,
much less to sing them, or to hear them sung with any real sympathy.
The boxes, splendid as they are, and splendid as the appearance of
those in them is, do not breathe a spirit of enjoyment. They are
rather like the sick wards of luxury and idleness, where people of a
certain class are condemned to perform the quarantine of fashion for
the evening. The rest of the spectators are sulky and self-important,
and the only idea which each person has in his head, seems to be
that he is at the opera. Little interest is shewn in the singing or
dancing, little pleasure appears to be derived from either, and the
audience seem only to be stunned and stupified with wonder. The
satisfaction which the English feel in this entertainment is very much
<i>against the grain</i>. They are a people, jealous of being pleased in any
way but their own.</p>

<p class='c021'>We were particularly struck with the force of these remarks the
other evening in the gallery, where our fellow-countrymen seemed to
be only upon their good behaviour or self-defence against the ill-behaviour
of others, some persons asserting their right of talking loud
about their own affairs, and others resenting this, not as an interruption
of their pleasures, but as an encroachment on their privileges. Soon
after a Frenchman came in, and his eye at once fastened upon the
ballet. At a particular air, he could no longer contain himself, but
joined in chorus in an agreeable under-voice, as if he expected others
to keep time to him, and exclaiming, while he wiped his forehead
from an exuberance of satisfaction, his eyes glistening, and his face
shining, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah c’est charmant, c’est charmant!</span></i>’ Now this, being ourselves
English, we confess, gave us more pleasure than the opera or
the ballet, in both of which, however, we felt a considerable degree
of melancholy satisfaction, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">selon la coutume de notre pays</span></i>—according to
the custom of our country.</p>

<p class='c021'>The opera was Cosi fan Tutti, with Mozart’s music, and the
ballet was the Dansomanie. The music of the first of these is really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>enough (to borrow a phrase from a person who was also a great man
in his way) ‘to draw three souls out of one weaver:’ and as to the
ballet, it might make a Frenchman forget his country and all other
things. This ballet is certainly the essence of a ballet. What a
grace and a liveliness there is in it! What spirit and invention!
What can exceed the ingenuity of the dance in which the favoured
lover joins in with his mistress and the rival, and makes all sorts of
advances to her, and receives her favours, her pressures of the hand,
and even kisses, without being found out by the other, who thinks
all these demonstrations of fondness intended for him! What an
enthusiasm for art in the character of the master of the house, who is
seized by the Dansomanie! What a noble and disinterested zeal in
the pursuit and encouragement of his favourite science! What a
mechanical sprightliness in all about him, particularly in the servant
who throws down a whole equipage of china, while he is dancing
with it on his head, and is rewarded by his master for this proof of
devotion to his interests! What a sympathy throughout between the
heels and the head, between the heart and the fingers’ ends! The
Minuet de la Cour, danced in full dresses, and with the well-known
accompaniment of the music, put us in mind of the old chivalrous
times of the Duke de Nemours and the Princess of Cleves, or of
what really seems to us longer ago, the time when we ourselves used
to be called out at school before the assembled taste and fashion of
the neighbourhood, to go through this very dance with the partner
whom we had selected for this purpose, and presented with a bunch
of flowers on the occasion!</p>

<p class='c021'>The Opera had less justice done it than the Ballet. The laughing
Trio was spoiled by Mr. Naldi, who performs the part of an ‘Old
Philosopher’ in it, but who is more like an impudent valet or <i>major-domo</i>
of an hotel. We never saw any one so much at home; who
seems so little conscious of the existence of any one but himself, and
who throws his voice, his arms and legs about with such a total
disregard of <i>bienseance</i>. The character is a kind of Opera Pandarus,
who exposes the inconstancy of two young ladies, by entangling them
in an intrigue with their own lovers in disguise. Mr. Braham, we
are told, sings Mozart with a peculiar greatness of gusto. But this
greatness of gusto does not appear to us the real excellence of Mozart.
The song beginning <i>Secondate</i>, in which he and his friend (Signor
Begri) call upon the gentle zephyrs by moonlight to favour their
design, is exquisite, and ‘floats upon the air, smoothing the raven
down of darkness till it smiles.’</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And Silence wish’d, she might be never more</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Still to be so displaced.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Madame Fodor’s voice does not harmonize with the music of this
composer. It is hard, metallic, and jars like the reverberation of a
tight string. Mozart’s music should seem to come from the air, and
return to it. Madame Vestris is a pretty little figure, and is in this
respect a contrast to Madame Fodor.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>August 11, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>We have suffered two disappointments this week, one in seeing a
farce that was announced and acted at the English Opera, and the
other in not seeing one that was announced and not acted at the
Haymarket. We should hope that which is to come is the best;
for the other is very bad, as we think. Old Customs is a farce or
operetta, in which an uncle (Mr. Bartley) and his nephew (Mr.
Wrench) court the same young lady (Miss L. Kelly). She prefers
the nephew, from whom she has received several letters. These,
with her answers, she sends to Mr. Bartley in a packet or basket, to
convince him of her real sentiments, and of the impropriety of his
prosecuting his rivalry to his nephew. In the mean time, it being
Christmas or New Year’s Day (we forget which), Bartley’s servant
(Russell) receives a visit from his old mother, who, in this season of
compliments and presents, brings him a little sister in a basket, and
leaves it to his care, while she goes to see her acquaintance in the
village. Russell, after singing a ludicrous lullaby to the baby, goes
out himself and leaves it in the basket on the table, a great and
improbable neglect, no doubt, of his infant charge. His master
(Bartley) soon after comes in, and receives the letter from his mistress
(Miss L. Kelly) informing him of a present she has sent him <i>in a
basket</i>, meaning her packet of love-letters, and apologizing for the
abrupt method she has taken of unfolding the true state of her heart
and progress of her affections. Bartley looks about for this important
confidential basket, and finds that which the old woman had left with
her son, with its explanatory contents. At this indecency of the
young lady, and indignity offered to himself, he grows very much
incensed, struts and frets about the stage, and when Miss L. Kelly
herself, with her father and lover, comes to ask his decision upon the
question after the clear evidence which she has sent him, nothing can
come up to the violence of his rage and impatience, but the absurdity
of the contrivance by which it is occasioned. His nephew (Mr.
Wrench) provokes him still farther, by talking of a present which he
has left with him that morning, an embryo production of his efforts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>to please, meaning a manuscript comedy, but which Mr. Bartley confounds
with the living Christmas-box in the basket. A strange scene
of confusion ensues, in which every one is placed in as absurd and
ridiculous a situation as possible, till Russell enters and brings about
an unforeseen <i>denouement</i>, by giving an account of the adventures of
himself and his little brother.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such is the plot, and the wit is answerable to it. There was a
good deal of laughing, and it is better to laugh at nonsense than at
nothing. But really the humours of punch and the puppet-shew are
sterling, legitimate, classical comedy, compared with the stuff of
which the Muse of the new English Opera is weekly delivered.
But it is in vain to admonish. The piece, we understand, has since
been withdrawn.</p>

</div>

<div class='c019'><i>August 18, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The new Farce at the Haymarket-Theatre, called My Landlady’s
Night-Gown, is made of very indifferent stuff. It is very tedious
and nonsensical. Mr. Jones is the hero of the piece, and gives the
title to it; for being closely pressed by some bailiffs, he suddenly
slips on his Landlady’s Night-gown, and escapes in disguise from his
pursuers, by speaking in a feigned female voice to one of them, and
knocking the other down by an exertion of his proper and natural
prowess. Such is the story which he himself tells, to account for
the oddity of his first appearance. Yet the apology is not necessary.
Mr. Jones himself is always a greater oddity than his dress. There
is something in his face and manner that bids equal defiance to
disguise or ornament. The mind is affirmed by a great poet to be
‘its own place:’ and Nature, in making Mr. Jones, said to the
tailor, You have no business here. Whether he plays my Lord
Foppington in point-lace, or personates an old woman in My Landlady’s
Night-Gown, he is just the same lively, bustling, fidgetty,
staring, queer-looking mortal; and the gradations of his metamorphosis
from the nobleman to the footman are quite imperceptible. Yet he
is an actor not without merit; the town like him, and he knows it;
and as to ourselves, we have fewer objections to him the more we see
of him. Use reconciles one to any thing. The only part of this
entertainment which is at all entertaining, is the scene in which
Russell, as the tailor, measures Jones for a new suit of clothes. This
scene is not dull, but it is very gross, and the grossness is not carried
off by a proportionable degree of wit. We could point out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>instances, but not with decency. So we shall let it alone. Tokely’s
character is very well, but not so good as Crockery. He is an actor of
some humour, and he sometimes shews a happy conception of character;
but we hope he will never play Sir Benjamin Backbite again.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>New English Opera.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Miss Merry has disappointed us again, in not appearing in Rosetta.
We may perhaps take our revenge, by not saying a word about her
when she does come out. It was certainly a disappointment, though
Miss Kelly played the part in her stead, who is a fine sensible girl,
and sings not amiss. But there is that opening scene where Rosetta
and Lucinda sit and sing with their song-books in their hands among
the garden bowers and roses, for which we had screwed up our ears
to a most critical anticipation of delight, not to be soothed but
with the sweetest sounds. To enter into good acting, requires an
effort; but to hear soft music is a pleasure without any trouble.
Besides, we had seen Miss Stephens in Rosetta, and wanted to
compare notes. How then, Miss Merry, could you disappoint us?</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Horn executed the part of Young Meadows with his usual
ability and propriety, both as an actor and a singer. We also
think that Mr. Chatterley’s Justice Woodcock was a very excellent
piece of acting. The smile of recognition with which he turns
round to his old flame Rosetta, in the last scene, told completely.
Mrs. Grove’s Deborah Woodcock reminded us of Mrs. Sparks’s
manner of acting it, which we take to be a high compliment.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Incledon appeared for the first time on this stage, as Hawthorn,
and sung the usual songs with his well-known power and sweetness of
voice. He is a true old English singer, and there is nobody who
goes through a drinking song, a hunting song, or a sailor’s song like
him. He makes a very loud and agreeable noise without any meaning.
At present he both speaks and sings as if he had a lozenge or
a slice of marmalade in his mouth. If he could go to America and
leave his voice behind him, it would be a great benefit—to the
parent country.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>New English Opera</i>) <i>Sept. 1, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>We hear nothing of Miss Merry; and there is nothing else at this
theatre that we wish to hear. Even Mr. Horn is nothing without
her; he stands alone and unsupported; and the ear loses its relish
and its power of judging of harmonious sounds, where it has nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>but harshness and discordance to compare them with. We are sorry
to include in this censure Miss Kelly, whose attempts to supply the
place of <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Prima Donna</span></i> of the English Opera, do great credit to her
talents, industry, and good-nature, but still they have not given her a
voice, which is indispensable to a singer, as singing is to an Opera.
If the Managers think it merely necessary to get some one to <i>go
through</i> the different songs in Artaxerxes, the Beggar’s Opera, or
Love in a Village, they might hire persons to read them through at a
cheaper rate; and in either case, we fear they must equally have to
hire the audience as well as the actors. Mr. Incledon sung the duet
of ‘All’s well,’ the other night, with Mr. Horn, in the Castle of
Andalusia, and has repeated it every evening since. Both singers
were very much and deservedly applauded in it. Mr. Incledon’s
voice is certainly a fine one, but its very excellence makes us regret
that its modulation is not equal to its depth and compass. His best
notes come from him involuntarily, or are often misplaced. The
effect of his singing is something like standing near a music-seller’s shop,
where some idle person is trying the different instruments; the flute,
the trumpet, the bass-viol, give forth their sounds of varied strength
and sweetness, but without order or connection.</p>

<p class='c021'>One of the novelties of the Castle of Andalusia, as got up at this
theatre, was Mr. Herring’s Pedrillo; an odd fish certainly, a very
outlandish person, and whose acting is altogether incoherent and gross,
but with a certain strong relish in it. It is only <i>too much</i> of a <i>good
thing</i>. His oil has not salt enough to qualify it. He has a great
power of exhibiting the ludicrous and absurd; but by its being either
not like, or over-done, the ridicule falls upon himself instead of the
character. Indeed he is literally to the comedian, what the
caricaturist is to the painter; and his representation of footmen and
fine gentlemen, is just such as we see in Gillray’s shop-window. The
same thing perhaps is not to be borne on the stage, though we laugh
at it till we are obliged to hold our sides, in a caricature. We do
not see, however, why this style of acting might not make a distinct
species of itself, like the Italian <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">opera buffa</span></i>, with Scaramouch,
Harlequin, and Pantaloon, among whom Mr. Herring would shine
like a gold fish in a glass-case.</p>

<p class='c021'>It was the opinion of Colley Cibber, a tolerable judge of such
matters, that in those degenerate days, the metropolis could only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>support one legitimate theatre, having a legitimate company, and
acting legitimate plays. In the present improved state of the drama,
which has ‘gone like a crab backwards,’ we are nearly of the same
opinion, in summer time at least. We critics have been for the last
two months like mice in an air-pump, gasping for breath, subsisting on
a sort of theatrical half-allowance. We hate coalitions in politics, but
we really wish the two little Theatres would club their stock of wit
and humour into one. We should then have a very tight, compact
little company, and crowded houses in the dog-days.</p>

<p class='c021'>The new after-piece of ‘Two Words,’ at the English Opera, is a
delightful little piece. It is a scene with robbers and midnight
murder in it; and all such scenes are delightful to the reader or
spectator. We can conceive nothing better managed than the plot of
this. The spell-bound silence and dumb-show of Rose, the servant
girl at the house in the forest, to which the benighted travellers come,
has an inimitable effect; and to make it complete, it is played by
Miss Kelly. The signals conveyed by the music of a lone flute in
such a place, and at such a time, thrill through the ear, and almost
suspend the breath. Mr. Short did not spoil the interest excited by
the story, and both Mr. Wilkinson and Mrs. Grove did justice to
the parts of the terrified servant, and the mischievous old housekeeper,
who is a dextrous accomplice in the dreadful scene. The
fault of the piece is, that the interest necessarily falls off in the second
act, which makes it rather tiresome, though the second appearance of
Miss Kelly in it, as the ward of Bartley at his great castle, is very
ingeniously contrived, and occasions some droll perplexities to her
lover, Don ——, whose life she has just saved from the hands of the
assassins, only escaping from their vengeance herself by the arrival of
her valorous guardian and a party of his soldiers. On the whole,
this is the best novelty that has been brought out during the season at
the English Opera, and we wish it every possible success.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Terry last week had for his benefit the Surrender of Calais.
He played the part of Eustace de St. Pierre in it with judgment and
energy, but without a pleasing effect. When Mr. Terry plays these
tragic characters,</p>

<p class='c021'>He sticks in tragedy like a man in the mud; or to borrow a
higher figure from a learned critic, ‘he resembles a person walking on
stilts in a morass.’ We shall always be glad to lift him out of it into
the common path of unpretending comedy: there he succeeds, and is
himself. The Surrender of Calais is as interesting as a tragedy can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>be without poetry in it. It has considerable pathos, though of a kind
which borders on the shocking too much. It requires accomplished
actors to carry it off; but it was not, in the present instance, very
heroically cast. The Haymarket Theatre inclines more to comedy
than to tragedy; and there are several scenes in this tragedy (for
such it really is <i>till it is over</i>), which, ‘not to be hated,’ should be
seen at the greatest possible distance that the stage allows. One
advantage, at least, of our overgrown theatres is, that they throw the
most distressing objects into a milder historical perspective.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>Sept. 15, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The Wonder is one of our good old English Comedies, which
holds a happy medium between grossness and refinement. The plot
is rich in intrigue, and the dialogue in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i>, which however
is so light and careless, as only to occasion a succession of agreeable
alarms to the ears of delicacy. This genuine comedy, which is quite
as pleasant to read as to see (for we have made the experiment
within these few days, to our entire satisfaction) was written by an
Englishwoman, before the sentimental, Ultra-Jacobinical German
School, of which a short and amusing account has been lately given in
the Courier, had spoiled us with their mawkish platonics and maudlin
metaphysics. The soul is here with extreme simplicity considered as
a mere accessary to the senses in love, and the conversation of bodies
preferred to that of minds as much more entertaining. We do not
subscribe our names to this opinion, but it is Mrs. Centlivre’s, and we
do not chuse to contradict a lady. The plot is admirably calculated
for stage-effect, and kept up with prodigious ingenuity and vivacity to
the end. The spectator is just beginning to be tired with the variety
of stratagems that follow and perplex one another, when the whole
difficulty is happily unravelled in the last scene. The <i>dove-tailing</i> of
the incidents and situations (so that one unexpected surprise gives
place to another, and the success of the plot is prevented by the
unluckiest accident in the world happening in the very nick of
time) supplies the place of any great force of character or sentiment.
The time for the entrance of each person on the stage is the moment
when they are least wanted, and when their arrival makes either
themselves or somebody else look as foolish as possible. The Busy
Body shews the same talent for invention and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-d’œil</span></i> for theatrical
effect, and the laughableness of both comedies depends on a brilliant
series of mis-timed exits and entrances. The Wonder is not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>however, without a moral; it exhibits a rare example of a woman
keeping a secret, for the sake of a female friend, which she is under
every temptation to break, and her resolution and fidelity are, after a
number of mortifying accidents and fears, happily rewarded by the
triumph both of her friendship and her love. The situation of
Violante is more prominent than her character; or, at least, the
character is more moral than entertaining. She is a young lady of
great goodness of heart and firmness of principle, but who neither
displays any great superiority of wit in extricating herself from the
difficulties in which her regard for the safety of her friend involves
her, nor of spirit in repelling the insinuations to which her reputation
is exposed in the eyes of her lover. She submits to her situation
with firmness of purpose and conscious reliance on her own
innocence.</p>

<p class='c021'>Miss Boyle, the young lady who appeared in this character on
Friday, shewed herself not incompetent to its successful delineation.
Her figure is tall, and her face, though her features are small, is
pretty and expressive. Her articulation (for a first appearance) was
remarkably distinct, and her voice is full and sweet. It is however
rather sentimental than comic. She rounds her words too much,
nor do they come ‘trippingly from the tongue.’ It is sufficient
if the dialogue of genteel comedy comes with light-fluttering grace
and gay animation from the lips; it should not come labouring up all
the way from the heart. This young lady’s general demeanour is
easy and unaffected; and when she has overcome her timidity, we
have no doubt she will give considerable spirit and dignity to the
more serious scenes of the story. Her smile has much archness and
expression; and we hope, from the promise of taste and talent which
she gave through her whole performance, that she will prove an
acquisition to the stage, in a line of comedy in which we are at
present absolutely deficient. She was very favourably received
throughout.</p>

<p class='c021'>We do not think the play in general was well got up. Charles
Kemble seemed to be rehearsing Don Felix with an eye to Macduff,
or some face-making tragic character. He was only excellent in the
drunken scene. Mrs. Gibbs at one time fairly took wing across the
stage, and played the chamber-maid with too little restraint from
vulgar decorums. Mr. Abbott never acts ill, but he does not answer
to our idea of Colonel Briton. Emery’s Gibby was sturdy enough,
and seemed to prove what he himself says, that ‘a Scotchman is not

<div class='c019'><i>September 22, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>A Mr. Macready appeared at Covent-Garden Theatre on Monday
and Friday, in the character of Orestes, in the Distressed Mother, a
bad play for the display of his powers, in which, however, he succeeded
in making a decidedly favourable impression upon the audience.
His voice is powerful in the highest degree, and at the same time
possesses great harmony and modulation. His face is not equally
calculated for the stage. He declaims better than any body we have
lately heard. He is accused of being violent, and of wanting pathos.
Neither of these objections is true. His manner of delivering the
first speeches in this play was admirable, and the want of increasing
interest afterwards was the fault of the author, rather than the actor.
The fine suppressed tone in which he assented to Pyrrhus’s command
to convey the message to Hermione was a test of his variety of
power, and brought down repeated acclamations from the house. We
do not lay much stress on his mad-scene, though that was very good
in its kind, for mad-scenes do not occur very often, and when they
do, had in general better be omitted. We have not the slightest
hesitation in saying, that Mr. Macready is by far the best tragic actor
that has come out in our remembrance, with the exception of Mr.
Kean. We however heartily wish him well out of this character of
Orestes. It is a kind of forlorn hope in tragedy. There is nothing
to be made of it on the English stage, beyond experiment. It is a
trial, not a triumph. These French plays puzzle an English audience
exceedingly. They cannot attend to the actor, for the difficulty they
have in understanding the author. We think it wrong in any actor
of great merit (which we hold Mr. Macready to be) to come out in
an ambiguous character, to salve his reputation. An actor is like a
man who throws himself from the top of a steeple by a rope. He
should chuse the highest steeple he can find, that if he does not
succeed in coming safe to the ground, he may break his neck at once,
and so put himself and the spectators out of farther pain.</p>

<p class='c021'>Ambrose Phillips’s Distressed Mother is a very good translation
from Racine’s Andromache. It is an alternation of topics, of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pros</span></i>
and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cons</span></i>, on the casuistry of domestic and state affairs, and produced
a great effect of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> on the audience. When you hear one of the
speeches in these rhetorical tragedies, you know as well what will be
the answer to it, as when you see the tide coming up the river—you
know that it will return again. The other actors filled their parts
with successful mediocrity.</p>

<p class='c021'>We highly disapprove of the dresses worn on this occasion, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>supposed to be the exact Greek costume. We do not know that the
Greek heroes were dressed like women, or wore their long hair
strait down their backs. Or even supposing that they did, this is not
generally known or understood by the audience; and though the
preservation of the ancient costume is a good thing, it is of more
importance not to shock our present prejudices. The managers of
Covent-Garden are not the Society of Antiquaries. The attention to
costume is only necessary to preserve probability: in the present
instance, it could only violate it, because there is nothing to lead the
public opinion to expect such an exhibition. We know how the
Turks are dressed, from seeing them in the streets; we know the
costume of the Greek statues, from seeing casts in the shop-windows:
we know that savages go naked, from reading voyages and travels:
but we do not know that the Grecian Chiefs at the Siege of Troy
were dressed as Mr. Charles Kemble, Mr. Abbott, and Mr.
Macready were the other evening in the Distressed Mother. It is a
discovery of the Managers; and they should have kept their secret to
themselves.—The epithet in Homer, applied to the Grecian warriors,
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κάρη κομόωντες</span>, is not any proof. It signifies not <i>long-haired</i>, but
literally <i>bushy-headed</i>, which would come nearer to the common
Brutus head, than this long dangling slip of hair. The oldest and
most authentic models we have are the Elgin Marbles, and it is
certain the Theseus is a <i>crop</i>. One would think this standard might
satisfy the Committee of Managers in point of classical antiquity.
But no such thing. They are much deeper in Greek costume and
the history of the fabulous ages than those old-fashioned fellows, the
Sculptors who lived in the time of Pericles. But we have said quite
enough on this point.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>Drury-Lane.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The chief novelties at this Theatre for the present week, have been
a Mr. Bengough, from the Theatre Royal, Bath, and a Mrs. Knight,
of the York Theatre, who have appeared in the characters of Baron
Wildenheim and Agatha Friburg, in Lovers’ Vows. Both have
been successful. Mr. Bengough is an actor who shews considerable
judgment and feeling, and who would produce more effect than he
does, if he took less pains to produce it. The appearance of study
takes from that of nature, and yet the expression of natural pathos is
what he seems to excel in. He treads the stage well, and is, we
think, an acquisition to the company.</p>

<p class='c021'>We wonder the long-winded, heavy-handed writer in the Courier,
who has been belabouring Bertram so woefully, does not fall foul of
Lovers’ Vows, as the quintessence of metaphysical licentiousness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the ultra-Jacobinism of ultra-Jacobinical poetry. We think that
everlasting writer might build thirty columns of lumbering criticisms,
‘pointing to the skies,’ on any single passage of this effusion of
German sentiment and genius. We hope the worthy author will
take this hint, and after he has exhausted upon this work the
inexhaustible stores of his unspeakable discoveries and researches into
the theory of mill-stones, we would recommend him to turn his pen to
an almost forgotten play, called Remorse, at the bottom of which, if
he will look narrowly, he will find ‘a vaporous drop profound’ of
the same pernicious leaven; and by setting it fermenting, with the
help of transcendental reasoning, and the mechanical operations of the
spirit, may raise mists and clouds that will ascend above the moon,
and turn the Courier office into a laundry!—Oh, we had forgot:
Mrs. Mardyn played her old character of Amelia Wildenheim more
charmingly than ever. She acts even with more grace and spirit
than when she first came out in it, and looks as handsome as she used
to do.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>October 6, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>We have had a considerable treat this week, in Miss Boyle’s
Rosalind, at Covent-Garden Theatre. It is one of the chastest and
most pleasing pieces of comic acting we have seen for some time.
We did not think much of her in Violante, which might be owing to
the diffidence of a first appearance, or to the little she has to do in
the character. But she rises with her characters, and really makes a
very charming Rosalind. The words of Shakespear become her
mouth, and come from it with a delicious freshness, which gives us
back the sense. There should be in the tones of the voice, to repeat
Shakespear’s verses properly, something resembling the sound of
musical glasses. He has himself given us his idea on this subject,
where he says, ‘How silver sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night.’
We were not satisfied with Miss Boyle’s enunciation in Violante. It
wanted lightness and grace. Her Rosalind was spoken with more
effect, and with more gaiety at the same time. The sentiment
seemed to infuse into her the true comic spirit, and her acting
improved with the wit and vivacity of the passages she had to deliver.
This would be a defect in a character of mere manners, like Lady
Townley, where there is always supposed to be an air or affectation
of a certain agreeable vivacity or fashionable tone; but in a character
of nature, like Rosalind, who is supposed to speak only what she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>thinks, and to express delight only as she feels it, it was a great
beauty. Her eyes also became more sparkling, and her smile more
significant, according to the <i>naiveté</i> and force of what she had to
utter. The highest compliment we can pay her acting is by applying
to it what Shakespear has somewhere said of poetry—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Our poesy is a gum that issues</div>
      <div class='line'>From whence ’tis nourish’d. The fire i’th’ flint</div>
      <div class='line'>Shews not till it be struck. Our gentle flame</div>
      <div class='line'>Provokes itself, and like the current flies</div>
      <div class='line'>Each bound in chafes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>To realize this description would be the perfection of comic
acting. We must not forget her Cuckoo-song; indeed we could
not, if we would. It was quite delightful. The tone and manner
in which she repeated the word Cuckoo, was as arch and provoking
as possible, and seemed to grow more saucy every time by the
repetition, but still, though it hovered very near them, it was restrained
from passing the limits of delicacy and propriety. She was deservedly
<i>encored</i> in it; though this circumstance seemed to throw her into
some little confusion. We have, however, two faults to find, both
of which may be easily remedied. The first is, that there is a
tendency to a lisp in some of her words: the second is, that there
is a trip in her gait, and too great a disposition to keep in motion
while she is speaking, or to go up to the persons she is addressing,
as if they were deaf. Both these are defects of inexperience: the
two necessary qualities for any young actress to set out with, in
the higher comedy, are liveliness and elegance, or in other words,
feeling with delicacy, and these we think Miss Boyle possesses.
We were a good deal pleased with Mr. Young’s Jaques. He spoke
several passages well, and is upon the whole an <i>improving</i> actor.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Macready’s Bentevole, in the Italian Lover, is very highly
spoken of. We only saw the last act of it, but it appeared to us to
be very fine in its kind. It was natural, easy, and forcible. Indeed,
we suspect some parts of it were too natural, that is, that Mr.
Macready thought too much of what his feelings might dictate in
such circumstances, rather than of what the circumstances must
have dictated to him to do. We allude particularly to the half
significant, half hysterical laugh, and distorted jocular leer, with his
eyes towards the persons accusing him of the murder, when the
evidence of his guilt comes out. Either the author did not intend
him to behave in this manner, or he must have made the other parties
on the stage interrupt him as a self-convicted criminal. His appeal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>to Manoah (the witness against him) to suppress the proofs which
must be fatal to his honour and his life, was truly affecting. His
resumption of a spirit of defiance was not sufficiently dignified, and
was more like the self-sufficient swaggering airs of comedy, than the
real grandeur of tragedy, which should always proceed from passion.
Mr. Macready sometimes, to express uneasiness and agitation, composes
his cravat, as he would in a drawing-room. This is, we
think, neither graceful nor natural in extraordinary situations. His
tones are equally powerful and flexible, varying with the greatest
facility from the lowest to the highest pitch of the human voice.</p>

</div>

<div class='c019'><i>October 13, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>We have to speak this week of Mr. Macready’s Othello, at
Covent-Garden Theatre, and though it must be in favourable terms,
it cannot be in very favourable ones. We have been rather spoiled
for seeing any one else in this character, by Mr. Kean’s performance
of it, and also by having read the play itself lately. Mr. Macready
was more than respectable in the part; and he only failed because he
attempted to excel. He did not, however, express the individual
bursts of feeling, nor the deep and accumulating tide of passion which
ought to be given in Othello. It may perhaps seem an extravagant
illustration, but the idea which we think any actor ought to have of
this character, to play it to the height of the poetical conception, is
that of a majestic serpent wounded, writhing under its pain, stung to
madness, and attempting by sudden darts, or coiling up its whole
force, to wreak its vengeance on those about it, and falling at last a
mighty victim under the redoubled strokes of its assailants. No one
can admire more than we do the force of genius and passion which
Mr. Kean shews in this part, but he is not stately enough for it. He
plays it like a gipsey, and not like a Moor. We miss in Mr. Kean
not the physiognomy, or the costume, so much as the <i>architectural</i>
building up of the part. This character always puts us in mind of
the line—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let Afric on its hundred thrones rejoice.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>It not only appears to hold commerce with meridian suns, and that
its blood is made drunk with the heat of scorching skies; but it
indistinctly presents to us all the symbols of eastern magnificence. It
wears a crown and turban, and stands before us like a tower. All
this, it may be answered, is only saying that Mr. Kean is not so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>tall as a tower: but any one, to play Othello properly, ought to
look taller and grander than any tower. We shall see how
Mr. Young will play it. But this is from our present purpose.
Mr. Macready is tall enough for the part, and the looseness of his
figure was rather in character with the flexibility of the South:
but there were no sweeping outlines, no massy movements in his
action.</p>

<p class='c021'>The movements of passion in Othello (and the motions of the
body should answer to those of the mind) resemble the heaving of
the sea in a storm; there are no sharp, slight, angular transitions, or
if there are any, they are subject to this general swell and commotion.
Mr. Kean is sometimes too wedgy and determined; but Mr.
Macready goes off like a shot, and startles our sense of hearing.
One of these sudden explosions was when he is in such haste to
answer the demands of the Senate on his services: ‘I do agnise
a natural hardness,’ &amp;c. as if he was impatient to exculpate himself
from some charge, or wanted to take them at their word lest they
should retract. There is nothing of this in Othello. He is calm
and collected; and the reason why he is carried along with such
vehemence by his passions when they are roused, is, that he is moved
by their collected force. Another fault in Mr. Macready’s conception
was, that he whined and whimpered once or twice, and tried
to affect the audience by affecting a pitiful sensibility, not consistent
with the dignity and masculine imagination of the character: as
where he repeated, ‘No, not much moved,’ and again, ‘Othello’s
occupation’s gone,’ in a childish treble. The only part which
should approach to this effeminate tenderness of complaint is his
reflection, ‘Yet, oh the pity of it, Iago, the pity of it!’ What we
liked best was his ejaculation, ‘Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, <i>for
’tis of aspick’s tongues</i>.’ This was forcibly given, and as if his
expression were choaked with the bitterness of passion. We do not
know how he would have spoken the speech, ‘Like to the Pontic
sea that knows no ebb,’ &amp;c. which occurs just before, for it was left
out. There was also something fine in his uneasiness and inward
starting at the name of Cassio, but it was too often repeated, with a
view to effect. Mr. Macready got most applause in such speeches
as that addressed to Iago, ‘Horror on horror’s head accumulate!’
This should be a lesson to him. He very injudiciously, we think,
threw himself on a chair at the back of the stage, to deliver the
farewell apostrophe to Content, and to the ‘pride, pomp, and circumstance
of glorious war.’ This might be a relief to him, but it
distressed the audience.—On the whole, we think Mr. Macready’s
powers are more adapted to the declamation than to the acting of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>passion: that is, that he is a better orator than actor. As to
Mr. Young’s Iago, ‘we never saw a gentleman acted finer.’ Mrs.
Faucit’s Desdemona was very pretty. Mr. C. Kemble’s Cassio
was excellent.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>Drury-Lane.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The town has been entertained this week by seeing Mr. Stephen
Kemble in the part of Sir John Falstaff, as they were formerly with
seeing Mr. Lambert in his own person. We see no more reason
why Mr. Stephen Kemble should play Falstaff, than why Louis <span class='fss'>XVIII</span>.
is qualified to fill a throne, because he is fat, and belongs to a
particular family. Every fat man cannot represent a great man.
The knight was fat; so is the player: the Emperor was fat, so is
the King who stands in his shoes. But there the comparison ends.
There is no sympathy in mind—in wit, parts, or discretion. Sir
John (and so we may say of the gentleman at St. Helena) ‘had guts
in his brains.’ The mind was the man. His body did not weigh
down his wit. His spirits shone through him. He was not a mere
paunch, a bag-pudding, a lump of lethargy, a huge falling sickness, an
imminent apoplexy, with water in the head.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Managers of Drury-Lane, in providing a Sir John Falstaff
to satisfy the taste of the town, seem to ask only with Mr. Burke’s
political carcass-butchers, ‘How he cuts up in the cawl: how he
tallows in the kidneys!’ We are afraid the Junto of Managers of
Drury-Lane are not much wiser than the junto of Managers of the
affairs of Europe. This, according to the luminous and voluminous
critic in the Courier, is because their affairs are not under the management
of a single person. Would the same argument prove that the
affairs of Europe had better have been under the direction of one
man? ‘The gods have not made’ the writer in the Courier logical
as well as ‘poetical.’ By the rule above hinted at, every actor is
qualified to play Falstaff who is physically incapacitated to play any
other character. Sir John Falstaffs may be fatted up like prize oxen.
Nor does the evil in this case produce its own remedy, as where an
actor’s success depends upon his own leanness and that of the part
he plays. Sir Richard Steele tells us (in one of the Tatlers) of a
poor actor in his time, who having nothing to do, fell away, and
became such a wretched meagre-looking object, that he was pitched
upon as a proper person to represent the starved Apothecary in
Romeo and Juliet. He did this so much to the life, that he was
repeatedly called upon to play it: but his person improving with his
circumstances, he was in a short time rendered unfit to play it with
the same effect as before, and laid aside. Having no other resource,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>he accordingly fell away again with the loss of his part, and was
again called upon to appear in it with his former reputation. Any
one, on the contrary, who thrives in Falstaff, is always in an
increasing capacity to overlay the part.—But we have done with
this unpleasant subject.</p>

</div>

<div class='c019'><i>October 20, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>There have been two theatrical or operatic debuts, to which we
are in arrears, and of which we must say a word—Miss Mori’s
Rosetta in Love in a Village, at Covent-Garden, and Miss Keppel’s
Polly in the Beggar’s Opera, at Drury-Lane. Both of them appeared
to us to be indifferent. Miss Mori is by much the best singer of the
two, but there is something exceedingly unprepossessing and hard
both in her voice and manner. She sings without the least feeling,
or lurking consciousness that such a thing is required in a singer.
The notes proceed from her mouth as mechanically, as <i>unmitigated</i> by
the sentiment, as if they came from the sharp hautboy or grating
bassoon. We do not mean that her voice is disagreeable in itself,
but it wants softness and sweetness of modulation. The words of
the songs neither seem to tremble on her lips, nor play around her
heart. Miss Mori did not look the character. Rosetta is to be
sure a waiting-maid, but then she is also a young lady in disguise.
There was no appearance of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognita</span></i> in Miss Mori. She seemed
in downright earnest, like one of the country girls who come to be
hired at the statute-fair. She was quite insensible of her situation,
and came forward to prove herself a fine singer, as one of her
fellow-servants might have done to answer to a charge of having
stolen something. We never saw a <i>debutante</i> more at ease with
the audience: we suppose she has played in the country. Miss
Matthews, who is a good-natured girl, and wished to <i>patronize</i>
her on so delicate an emergency, presently found there was no
occasion for her services, and withdrew from the attempt with some
trepidation.</p>

<p class='c021'>If Miss Mori did not enchant us by her incomprehensible want of
sensibility, neither did Miss Keppel by the affectation of it. Sensibility
is a very pretty thing, but it will not do to make a plaything
of, at least in public. It is not enough that an actress tries to atone
for defects by throwing herself on the indulgence of the audience:—their
eyes and ears must be satisfied, as well as their self-love. Miss
Keppel acts with very little grace, and sings very much out of tune.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>There were some attempts made to prejudice the audience against this
young lady before she appeared: but they only had the effect which
they deserved, of procuring a more flattering reception than she would
otherwise have met with: but we do not think she will ever become
a favourite with the town.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c008'>MR. KEMBLE’S CATO</h3>

<div class='c019'><i>October 27, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kemble has resumed his engagements at Covent-Garden
Theatre for the season; it is said in the play-bills, for the last time.
There is something in the word <i>last</i>, that, ‘being mortal,’ we do not
like on these occasions: but there is this of good in it, that it throws
us back on past recollections, and when we are about to take leave of
an old friend, we feel desirous to settle all accounts with him, and to
see that the balance is not against us, on the score of gratitude.
Mr. Kemble will, we think, find that the public are just, and his last
season, if it is to be so, will not, we hope, be the least brilliant of his
career. As his meridian was bright, so let his sunset be golden, and
without a cloud. His reception in Cato, on Friday, was most flattering,
and he well deserved the cheering and cordial welcome which he
received. His voice only failed him in strength; but his tones, his
looks, his gestures, were all that could be required in the character.
He is the most classical of actors. He is the only one of the
moderns, who both in figure and action approaches the beauty and
grandeur of the antique. In the scene of the soliloquy, just before
his death, he was rather inaudible, and indeed the speech itself is not
worth hearing; but his person, manner, and dress, seemed cast in the
very mould of Roman elegance and dignity.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>THE IRON CHEST</h3>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c019'><i>December 1, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The Iron Chest is founded on the story of Caleb Williams, one
of the best novels in the language, and the very best of the modern
school: but the play itself is by no means the best play that ever was
written, either in ancient or modern times, though really in modern
times we do not know of any much better. Mr. Colman’s serious
style, which is in some measure an imitation of Shakespear’s, is
natural and flowing; and there is a constant intermixture as in our
elder drama, a <i>melange</i> of the tragic and comic; but there is rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>a want of force and depth in the impassioned parts of his tragedies,
and what there is of this kind, is impeded in its effect by the comic.
The two plots (the serious and ludicrous) do not seem going on and
gaining ground at the same time, but each part is intersected and
crossed by the other, and has to set out again in the next scene,
after being thwarted in the former one, like a person who has to
begin a story over again in which he has been interrupted. In
Shakespear, the comic parts serve only as a relief to the tragic.
Colman’s tragic scenes are not high-wrought enough to require any
such relief; and this perhaps may be a sufficient reason why modern
writers, who are so sparing of their own nerves, and those of their
readers, should not be allowed to depart from the effeminate simplicity
of the classic style. In Shakespear, again, the comic
varieties are only an accompaniment to the loftier tragic movement:
at least the only exception is in the part of Falstaff in Henry <span class='fss'>IV.</span>
which is not however a tragedy of any deep interest:—in Colman
you do not know whether the comedy or tragedy is principal;
whether he made the comic for the sake of the tragic, or the
tragic for the sake of the comic; and you suspect he would be
as likely as any of his contemporaries to parody his own most
pathetic passages, just as Munden caricatures the natural touches of
garrulous simplicity in old Adam Winterton, to make the galleries
and boxes laugh. The great beauty of Caleb Williams is lost in
the play. The interest of the novel arises chiefly from two things:
the gradual working up of the curiosity of Caleb Williams with
respect to the murder, by the incessant goading on of which he
extorts the secret from Falkland, and then from the systematic
persecution which he undergoes from his master, which at length
urges him to reveal the secret to the world. Both these are very
ingeniously left out by Mr. Colman, who jumps at a conclusion, but
misses his end.</p>

<p class='c021'>The history of the Iron Chest is well known to dramatic readers.
Mr. Kemble either could not, or would not play the part of Sir
Edward Mortimer (the Falkland of Mr. Godwin’s novel)—he made
nothing of it, or at least, made short work of it, for it was only
played one night. He had a cough and a cold, and he hemmed
and hawed, and whined and drivelled through the part in a marvellous
manner. Mr. Colman was enraged at the ill-success of his
piece, and charged it upon Kemble’s acting, who he said did
not do his best. Now we confess he generally tries to do his best,
and if that best is no better, it is not his fault. We think the fault
was in the part, which wants circumstantial dignity. Give Mr.
Kemble only the <i>man</i> to play, why, he is nothing; give him the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>paraphernalia of greatness, and he is great. He ‘wears his heart in
compliment extern.’ He is the statue on the pedestal, that cannot
come down without danger of shaming its worshippers; a figure that
tells well with appropriate scenery and dresses; but not otherwise.
Mr. Kemble contributes his own person to a tragedy—but only that.
The poet must furnish all the rest, and make the other parts equally
dignified and graceful, or Mr. Kemble will not help him out. He
will not lend dignity to the mean, spirit to the familiar; he will not
impart life and motion, passion and imagination, to all around him,
for he has neither life nor motion, passion nor imagination in himself.
He minds only the conduct of his own person, and leaves the piece
to shift for itself. Not so Mr. Kean. ‘Truly he hath a devil;’
and if the fit comes over him too often, yet as tragedy is not the
representation of <i>still-life</i>, we think this much better than being never
roused at all. We like</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The fiery soul that working out its way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fretted the pigmy body to decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er informed the tenement of clay.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Mr. Kean has passion and energy enough to afford to lend it to the
circumstances in which he is placed, without leaning upon them for
support. He can make a dialogue between a master and a servant in
common life, tragic, or infuse a sentiment into the Iron Chest. He is
not afraid of being let down by his company. Formal dignity and
studied grace are ridiculous, except in particular circumstances;
passion and nature are every where the same, and these Mr. Kean
carries with him into all his characters, and does not want the others.
In the last, however, which are partly things of manner and assumption,
he improves, as well as in the recitation of set speeches; for
example, in the Soliloquy on Honour, in the present play. His
description of the assassination of his rival to Wilford was admirable,
and the description of his ‘seeing his giant form roll before him in
the dust,’ was terrific and grand. In the picturesque expression of
passion, by outward action, Mr. Kean is unrivalled. The transitions
in this play, from calmness to deep despair, from concealed suspicion
to open rage, from smooth decorous indifference to the convulsive
agonies of remorse, gave Mr. Kean frequent opportunities for the
display of his peculiar talents. The mixture of common-place
familiarity and solemn injunction in his speeches to Wilford when
in the presence of others, was what no other actor could give with
the same felicity and force. The last scene of all—his coming to
life again after his swooning at the fatal discovery of his guilt, and
then falling back after a ghastly struggle, like a man waked from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>tomb, into despair and death in the arms of his mistress, was one of
those consummations of the art, which those who have seen and have
not felt them in this actor, may be assured that they have never seen
or felt any thing in the course of their lives, and never will to the end
of them.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>December 8, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>We wish we had never seen Mr. Kean. He has destroyed the
Kemble religion; and it is the religion in which we were brought up.
Never again shall we behold Mr. Kemble with the same pleasure
that we did, nor see Mr. Kean with the same pleasure that we have
seen Mr. Kemble formerly. We used to admire Mr. Kemble’s
figure and manner, and had no idea that there was any want of art or
nature. We feel the force and nature of Mr. Kean’s acting, but then
we feel the want of Mr. Kemble’s person. Thus an old and delightful
prejudice is destroyed, and no new enthusiasm, no second idolatry
comes to take its place. Thus, by degrees, knowledge robs us of
pleasure, and the cold icy hand of experience freezes up the warm
current of the imagination, and crusts it over with unfeeling criticism.
The knowledge we acquire of various kinds of excellence, as successive
opportunities present themselves, leads us to acquire a combination
of them which we never find realized in any individual, and all
the consolation for the disappointment of our fastidious expectations
is in a sort of fond and doating retrospect of the past. It is possible
indeed that the force of prejudice might often kindly step in to
suspend the chilling effects of experience, and we might be able to see
an old favourite by a voluntary forgetfulness of other things, as we
saw him twenty years ago; but his friends take care to prevent this,
and by provoking invidious comparisons, and crying up their idol as
a model of abstract perfection, force us to be ill-natured in our own
defence.</p>

<p class='c021'>We went to see Mr. Kemble’s King John, and he became the
part so well, in costume, look, and gesture, that if left to ourselves,
we could have gone to sleep over it, and dreamt that it was fine, and
‘when we waked, have cried to dream again.’ But we were told
that it was really fine, as fine as Garrick, as fine as Mrs. Siddons, as
fine as Shakespear; so we rubbed our eyes and kept a sharp look
out, but we saw nothing but a deliberate intention on the part of
Mr. Kemble to act the part finely. And so he did in a certain
sense, but not by any means as Shakespear wrote it, nor as it might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>be played. He did not harrow up the feelings, he did not electrify
the sense: he did not enter into the nature of the part himself, nor
consequently move others with terror or pity. The introduction to
the scene with Hubert was certainly excellent: you saw instantly, and
before a syllable was uttered, partly from the change of countenance,
and partly from the arrangement of the scene, the purpose which had
entered his mind to murder the young prince. But the remainder
of this trying scene, though the execution was elaborate—painfully
elaborate, and the outline well conceived, wanted the filling up, the
true and master touches, the deep piercing heartfelt tones of nature.
It was done well and skilfully, <i>according to the book of arithmetic</i>; but
no more. Mr. Kemble, when he approaches Hubert to sound his
disposition, puts on an insidious, insinuating, fawning aspect, and so
he ought; but we think it should not be, though it was, that kind
of wheedling smile, as if he was going to persuade him that the
business he wished him to undertake was a mere jest; and his
natural repugnance to it an idle prejudice, that might be carried off
by a certain pleasant drollery of eye and manner. Mr. Kemble’s
look, to our apprehension, was exactly as if he had just caught the
eye of some person of his acquaintance in the boxes, and was trying
to suppress a rising smile at the metamorphosis he had undergone
since dinner. Again, he changes his voice three several times, in
repeating the name of Hubert; and the changes might be fine, but
they did not vibrate on our feelings; so we cannot tell. They
appeared to us like a tragic <i>voluntary</i>. Through almost the whole
scene this celebrated actor did not seem to feel the part itself as
it was set down for him, but to be considering how he ought to
feel it, or how he should express by rule and method what he did
not feel. He was sometimes slow, and sometimes hurried: sometimes
familiar, and sometimes solemn: but always with an evident
design and determination to be so. The varying tide of passion did
not appear to burst from the source of nature in his breast, but to be
drawn from a theatrical leaden cistern, and then directed through
certain conduit-pipes and artificial channels, to fill the audience with
well regulated and harmless sympathy.</p>

<p class='c021'>We are afraid, judging from the effects of this representation, that
‘man delight not us, nor woman neither:’ for we did not like Miss
O’Neill’s Constance better, nor so well as Mr. Kemble’s King John.
This character, more than any other of Shakespear’s females, treads
perhaps upon the verge of extravagance; the impatience of grief,
combined with the violence of her temper, borders on insanity: her
imagination grows light-headed. But still the boundary between
poetry and phrensy is not passed: she is neither a virago nor mad.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Miss O’Neill gave more of the vulgar than the poetical side of the
character. She generally does so of late. Mr. Charles Kemble in
the Bastard, had the ‘bulk, the thews, the sinews’ of Falconbridge:
would that he had had ‘the spirit’ too. There was one speech
which he gave well—‘Could Sir Robert make this leg?’ And
suiting the action to the word, as well he might, it had a great effect
upon the house.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>December 15, 1816.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Coriolanus has of late been repeatedly acted at Covent-Garden
Theatre. Shakespear has in this play shewn himself well versed
in history and state-affairs. Coriolanus is a storehouse of political
common-places. Any one who studies it may save himself the
trouble of reading Burke’s Reflections, or Paine’s Rights of Man,
or the Debates in both Houses of Parliament since the French
Revolution or our own. The arguments for and against aristocracy,
or democracy, on the privileges of the few and the claims of the
many, on liberty and slavery, power and the abuse of it, peace and
war, are here very ably handled, with the spirit of a poet, and the
acuteness of a philosopher. Shakespear himself seems to have had
a leaning to the arbitrary side of the question, perhaps from some
feeling of contempt for his own origin; and to have spared no
occasion of baiting the rabble. What he says of them is very true:
what he says of their betters is also very true, though he dwells less
upon it. The cause of the people is indeed but ill calculated as a
subject for poetry: it admits of rhetoric, which goes into argument
and explanation, but it presents no immediate or distinct images to the
mind, ‘no jutting frieze, buttress, or coigne of vantage’ for poetry
‘to make its pendant bed and procreant cradle in.’ The language
of poetry naturally falls in with the language of power. The
imagination is an exaggerating and exclusive faculty: it takes from
one thing to add to another: it accumulates circumstances together
to give the greatest possible effect to a favourite object. The
understanding is a dividing and measuring faculty: it judges of
things, not according to their immediate impression on the mind,
but according to their relations to one another. The one is a
monopolizing faculty, which seeks the greatest quantity of present
excitement by inequality and disproportion; the other is a distributive
faculty, which seeks the greatest quantity of ultimate good by justice
and proportion. The one is an aristocratical, the other a republican
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>faculty. The principle of poetry is a very anti-levelling principle.
It aims at effect, it exists by contrast. It admits of no medium.
It is every thing by excess. It rises above the ordinary standard
of sufferings and crimes. It presents an imposing appearance. It
shews its head turretted, crowned and crested. Its front is gilt and
blood-stained. Before it, ‘it carries noise, and behind it, it leaves
tears.’ It has its altars and its victims, sacrifices, human sacrifices.
Kings, priests, nobles, are its train-bearers; tyrants and slaves its
executioners—‘Carnage is its daughter!’ Poetry is right royal.
It puts the individual for the species, the one above the infinite many,
might before right. A lion hunting a flock of sheep or a herd of
wild asses, is a more poetical object than they; and we even take
part with the lordly beast, because our vanity, or some other feeling,
makes us disposed to place ourselves in the situation of the strongest
party. So we feel some concern for the poor citizens of Rome,
when they meet together to compare their wants and grievances,
till Coriolanus comes in, and, with blows and big words, drives this
set of ‘poor rats,’ this rascal scum, to their homes and beggary,
before him. There is nothing heroical in a multitude of miserable
rogues not wishing to be starved, or complaining that they are like to
be so; but when a single man comes forward to brave their cries,
and to make them submit to the last indignities, from mere pride and
self-will, our admiration of his prowess is immediately converted into
contempt for their pusillanimity. The insolence of power is stronger
than the plea of necessity. The tame submission to usurped
authority, or even the natural resistance to it, has nothing to excite
or flatter the imagination; it is the assumption of a right to insult
or oppress others, that carries an imposing air of superiority with it.
We had rather be the oppressor than the oppressed.</p>

<p class='c021'>The love of power in ourselves, and the admiration of it in others,
are both natural to man; the one makes him a tyrant, the other
a slave. Wrong, dressed out in pride, pomp, and circumstance, has
more attraction than abstract right.—Coriolanus complains of the
fickleness of the people: yet the instant he cannot gratify his pride
and obstinacy at their expense, he turns his arms against his country.
If his country was not worth defending, why did he build his pride
on its defence? He is a conqueror and a hero; he conquers other
countries, and makes this a plea for enslaving his own; and when he
is prevented from doing so, he leagues with its enemies to destroy
his country. He rates the people ‘as if he were a God to punish,
and not a man of their infirmity.’ He scoffs at one of their tribunes
for maintaining their rites and franchises: ‘Mark you his absolute
<i>shall</i>?’ not marking his own absolute <i>will</i> to take every thing from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>them; his impatience of the slightest opposition to his own pretensions
being in proportion to their arrogance and absurdity. If the great
and powerful had the beneficence and wisdom of gods, then all this
would have been well: if with greater knowledge of what is good
for the people, they had as great a care for their interest as they
have for their own; if they were seated above the world, sympathising
with their welfare, but not feeling the passions of men, receiving
neither good nor hurt from them, but bestowing their benefits as free
gifts on them, they might then rule over them like another Providence.
But this is not the case. Coriolanus is unwilling that the Senate
should shew their ‘cares’ for the people, lest their ‘cares’ should be
construed into ‘fears,’ to the subversion of all due authority; and he
is no sooner disappointed in his schemes to deprive the people not
only of the cares of the state, but of all power to redress themselves,
than Volumnia is made madly to exclaim,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,</div>
      <div class='line'>And occupations perish.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>This is but natural: it is but natural for a mother to have more
regard for her son than for a whole city: but then the city should be
left to take some care of itself. The care of the state cannot, we
here see, be safely entrusted to maternal affection, or to the domestic
charities of high life. The great have private feelings of their own,
to which the interests of humanity and justice must courtesy. Their
interests are so far from being the same as those of the community,
that they are in direct and necessary opposition to them; their power
is at the expense of our weakness; their riches, of our poverty; their
pride, of our degradation; their splendour, of our wretchedness;
their tyranny of our servitude. If they had the superior intelligence
ascribed to them (which they have not) it would only render them
so much more formidable; and from gods would convert them into
devils.</p>

<p class='c021'>The whole dramatic moral of Coriolanus is, that those who have
little shall have less, and that those who have much shall take all that
others have left. The people are poor, therefore they ought to be
starved. They are slaves, therefore they ought to be beaten. They
work hard, therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden.
They are ignorant, therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that
they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed,
and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions;
which seek to aggrandize what excites admiration, and to heap
contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make
wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods;
to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition
of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy
constructed upon the principles of <i>poetical justice</i>; it is a noble or
royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few, is death to the many,
and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set
upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase, though they do not share
in the spoil. We may depend upon it, that what men delight to read
in books, they will put in practice in reality.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kemble in the part of Coriolanus was as great as ever. Miss
O’Neill as Volumnia was not so great as Mrs. Siddons. There is a
<i>fleshiness</i>, if we may so say, about her whole manner, voice, and
person, which does not suit the character of the Roman Matron.
One of the most amusing things in the representation of this play is
the contrast between Kemble and little Simmons. The former seems
as if he would gibbet the latter on his nose, he looks so lofty. The
fidgetting, uneasy, insignificant gestures of Simmons are perhaps a
little caricatured; and Kemble’s supercilious airs and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nonchalance</span></i>
remind one of the unaccountable abstracted air, the contracted eyebrows
and suspended chin of a man who is just going to sneeze.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Henry Johnston (from the Glasgow Theatre) who came out
some time ago in Sir Archy Mac Sarcasm, with much applause,
appeared on Friday, in Sir Pertinax Mac Sycophant. During the
first acts, he went through this highly, but finely coloured part, with
great spirit and force: but in the midst of his account to his son
Egerton, of the manner in which he rose in the world by <i>booing</i>, and
by marrying an old dowager, ‘like a surgeon’s skeleton in a glass-case,’
a certain disapprobation, not of the actor, but of the sentiments
of the character, manifested itself through the house, which at this
season of the year is not of a very refined composition; and some one
cried out from the gallery for ‘another play.’ So little do the vulgar
know of courts and the great world, that they are even shocked and
disgusted at the satirical representation of them on the stage. This
unexpected interruption given to the actor in the most prominent
scene of the play, operated to damp his spirits considerably, nor did
he rally completely again for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>This is the second time that we have seen an actor fail in this
character, not by any fault in himself, but by the fault of the Managers,
in bringing them out in this part in the holiday season. The other
was Mr. Bibby last year, certainly not inferior to Mr. Johnston in
the conception or delineation of the sordid, gross, wily Scotchman:
but who was equally or more unsuccessful, from the unintelligibility
of the Scotch dialect and sentiments to the untutored and ‘unclerkly’
Christmas visitants. Upon the entrance indeed of Lord Castlereagh
and some company of the higher classes, into the Prince’s box,
Mr. Johnston seemed to recover himself a little, and to appeal with
more confidence from the ignorance of the rabble to these more
judicious appreciators of the merits of his delineation of Macklin’s
idea of a modern statesman.</p>

<p class='c021'>We wonder the Managers of either Theatre ever bring out a
comedy relating to the artificial manners of high life, on occasions
like the present. They ought either to have a tragedy and a pantomime,
or two pantomimes the same evening; or a melo-drama, a
puppet-show, and a pantomime. The common people like that which
strikes their senses or their imagination: they do not like Comedy,
because, if it is genteel, they do not understand the subject matter of
which it treats—and if it relates to low manners and incidents, it has
no novelty to recommend it. They like the dazzling and the wonderful.
One of the objections constantly made by some persons who
sat near us in the pit, to the play of the Man of the World, was, that
the same scene continued through the whole play. This was a great
disappointment to the pantomime appetite for rapid and wonderful
changes of scenery, with which our dramatic novices had come fully
prepared.</p>

<p class='c021'>The pantomime, with Mr. Grimaldi, soon brought all to rights,
and the audience drank in oblivion of all their grievances with the
first tones of their old friend Joe’s voice, for which indeed he might
be supposed to have a patent. This great man (we really think him
the greatest man we saw at the theatre last night) will not ‘die and
leave the world no copy,’ as Shakespear has it, for his son is as like
him in person as two peas. The new pantomime itself, or the
‘Beggar of Bethnal-green,’ is not a very good one. It has a clever
dog and a rope-dancing monkey in it. The degeneracy of the
modern stage threatens to be shortly redeemed by accomplished
recruits from the four-footed creation. The monkey was hissed and
encored, but this is the fate of all upstart candidates for popular
applause, and we hope that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</span></i> will console himself for this
partial ill-will and prejudice manifested against him, by the reflection
that envy is the shadow of merit.—Miss F. Dennett was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>Columbine, and played very prettily as the daughter of the Blind
Beggar. But who shall describe the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de trois</span></i> by the three Miss
Dennetts, ‘ever charming, ever new,’ and yet just the same as when
we saw them before, and as we always wish to see them? If they
were at all different from what they are, or from one another, it
would be for the worse. The charm is in seeing the same grace, the
same looks, the same motions, in three persons. They are a lovely
reflection of one another. The colours in the rainbow are not more
soft and harmonious; the image of the halcyon reflected on the azure
bosom of the smiling ocean is not more soft and delightful.</p>

<p class='c021'>Miss Somerville, who gave so interesting a promise of a fine tragic
actress in the part of Imogine in Bertram, last year, appeared the
other evening in Alicia in Jane Shore. We do not think Rowe’s
heroine so well adapted to the display of her powers as that of the
modern poet. Miss Somerville is a very delightful sentimental actress,
but she makes an indifferent scold. Alicia should be a shrew, and
shrill-tongued: but Miss Somerville throws a pensive repentant tone
over her bitterest imprecations against her rival, and her mode of
recitation is one melancholy cadence of the whole voice, silvered over
with sweet gleams of sound, like the moonbeams playing on the
heaving ocean. When she should grow sharp and virulent, she only
becomes more amiable and romantic, and tries in vain to be disagreeable.
Though her voice is out of her controul, she yet succeeds in
putting on a peevish dissatisfied look, which yet has too much of a
mournful, sanctified cast. If Mr. Coleridge could write a tragedy
for her, we should then see the Muse of the romantic drama exhibited
in perfection. The fault of Miss Somerville, in short, is, that her
delivery is too mannered, and her action without sufficient variety.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Bengough, as the Duke of Gloster, was in one or two scenes
impressive, in others ridiculous. He has a singular kind of awkward
energy and heavy animation about him. He works himself up occasionally
to considerable force and spirit; and then, as if frightened at
his own efforts, his purpose fails him, and he sinks into an unaccountable
vein of faltering insipidity. The great merit of Mr. Kean is his
thorough decision and self-possession: he always knows what he
means to do, and never flinches from doing it.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Humorous Lieutenant, brought out on Saturday week at
Covent-Garden, is a bad alteration from one of the most indifferent
of Beaumont and Fletcher’s plays. It went off very ill, and was as
fairly damned as any thing at Covent-Garden could be. They have
some <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus theatricum</span></i> here, which saves things and carries off appearances.
So the play has been brought forward again, and its first
failure attributed to the failure of the actress who played the part of
Celia. That was certainly a failure, and an unexpected one; for the
lady’s accomplishments and attractions had been much spoken of, and
perhaps justly. Of her talents for the stage, we shall say nothing;
for we cannot say a word or syllable in their favour. Nor shall we
say any thing against ‘The Humorous Lieutenant:’ for it passes

<div class='c019'><i>February 9, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>There have been two new ballets this week, one at each Theatre.
That at Drury-Lane, Patrick’s Return, is one of the prettiest things
we have seen a long time. The dancing and pantomime are very
delightfully adapted to a number of old Irish melodies, which we are
never tired of hearing.—Zephyr and Flora, at Covent-Garden, is
too fine by half for our rude tastes. There are lusty lovers flying
in the air, nests of winged Cupids, that start out of bulrushes, trees
that lift up their branches like arms:—we suppose they will speak
next like Virgil’s wood. But in the midst of all these wonders,
we have a more amiable wonder, the three Miss Dennetts, as
nymphs,</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Whom lovely Venus at a birth</div>
      <div class='line'>To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They might represent Love, Hope, and Joy. There is one part
in which they seem to dance on the strings of the harp which plays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>to them; the liquid sounds and the motion are the same. These
young ladies put us in mind of Florizel’s praise of Perdita:—</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>February 16, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>A Gentleman of the name of Booth, who we understand has been
acting with considerable applause at Worthing and Brighton, came
out in Richard Duke of Gloster, at this Theatre, on Wednesday.
We do not know well what to think of his powers, till we see him in
some part in which he is more himself. His face is adapted to tragic
characters, and his voice wants neither strength nor musical expression.
But almost the whole of his performance was an exact copy or
parody of Mr. Kean’s manner of doing the same part. It was a
complete, but at the same time a successful piece of plagiarism. We
do not think this kind of second-hand reputation can last upon the
London boards for more than a character or two. In the country
these <i>doubles</i> of the best London performers go down very well, for
they are the best they can get, and they have not the originals to
make invidious comparisons with. But it will hardly do to bring out
the same entertainment that we can have as it is first served up at
Drury-Lane, in a hashed state at Covent-Garden. We do not blame
Mr. Booth for borrowing Mr. Kean’s coat and feathers to appear in
upon a first and trying occasion, but if he wishes to gain a permanent
reputation, he must come forward in his own person. He must try
to be original, and not content himself with treading in another’s
steps. We say this the rather, because, as far as we could judge,
Mr. Booth, in point of execution did those passages the best, in which
he now and then took leave of Mr. Kean’s decided and extreme
manner, and became more mild and tractable. Such was his recitation
of the soliloquy on his own ambitious projects, and of that which
occurs the night before the battle. In these he seemed to yield to
the impulse of his own feelings, and to follow the natural tones and
cadence of his voice. They were the best parts of his performance.
The worst were those where he imitated, or rather caricatured
Mr. Kean’s hoarseness of delivery and violence of action, and affected
an energy without seeming to feel it. Such were his repulse of
Buckingham, his exclamation, ‘What does he in the north,’ &amp;c. his
telling the attendants to set down the corse of King Henry, &amp;c. The
scene with Lady Anne, on the contrary, which was of a softer and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>more insinuating kind, he was more successful in, and though still a
palpable imitation of Mr. Kean, it had all the originality that imitation
could have, for he seemed to feel it. His manner of saying
‘good night,’ and of answering, when he received the anonymous
paper, ‘A weak invention of the enemy,’ we consider as mere tricks
in the art, which no one but a professed mimic has a right to play.
The dying scene was without effect.—The greatest drawback to
Mr. Booth’s acting is a perpetual strut, and unwieldy swagger in his
ordinary gait and manner, which, though it may pass at Brighton for
<i>grand, gracious, and magnificent</i>, even the lowest of the mob will laugh
at in London. This is the third imitation of Mr. Kean we have
seen attempted, and the only one that has not been a complete failure.
The imitation of original genius is the <i>forlorn hope</i> of the candidates
for fame:—its faults are so easily overdone, its graces are so hard to
catch. A Kemble school we can understand: a Kean school is, we
suspect, a contradiction in terms. Art may be taught, because it is
learnt: Nature can neither be taught nor learnt. The secrets of Art
may be said to have a common or <i>pass</i> key to unlock them; the
secrets of Nature have but one master-key—the heart.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>Drury-Lane.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The charming afterpiece of Figaro, or the Follies of a Day, has
been revived here, and revived with all its gloss and lustre. Miss
Kelly, Mrs. Alsop, and Mrs. Orger, were all very happy in it. This
play was written by a man who drank light French wines: in every
line you see the brisk champagne frothing through green glasses. The
beads rise sparkling to the surface and then evaporate. There is
nothing in it to remember, and absolutely nothing to criticise; but it
is the triumph of animal spirits: while you see it, you seem to drink
ether, or to inhale an atmosphere not bred of fogs or sea-coal fires.
This is the secret of the charm of Figaro. It promotes the circulation
of the blood, and assists digestion. We would by all means
advise our readers to go and try the experiment. The best scene in
it, is that in which the Page jumps from his concealment behind the
arm-chair into the arm-chair itself. The beauty of this is in fact the
perfect <i>heartfelt</i> indifference to detection; and so of the rest.—We
never saw Mr. Rae play better.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Drury-Lane</i>) <i>February 23, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The Managers of Covent-Garden Theatre, after having announced
in the bills, that Mr. Booth’s Richard the Third had met with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>success unprecedented in the annals of histrionic fame, (which, to do
them justice, was not the case), very disinterestedly declined engaging
him at more than two pounds a week, as report speaks. Now we
think they were wrong, either in puffing him so unmercifully, or in
haggling with him so pitifully. It was either trifling with the public
or with the actor. The consequence, as it has turned out, has been,
that Mr. Booth, who was to start as ‘the fell opposite’ of Mr. Kean,
has been taken by the hand by that gentleman, who was an old
fellow-comedian of his in the country, and engaged at Drury-Lane
at a salary of ten pounds per week. So we hear. And it was in
evident allusion to this circumstance, that when Mr. Booth, as Iago,
said on Thursday night, ‘I know my price no less’—John Bull, who
has very sympathetic pockets, gave a loud shout of triumph, which
resounded all along the benches of the pit. We must say that
Mr. Booth pleased us much more in Iago than in Richard. He was,
it is true, well supported by Mr. Kean in Othello, but he also
supported him better in that character than any one else we have
seen play with him. The two rival actors hunt very well in couple.
One thing which we did not expect, and which we think reconciled
us to Mr. Booth’s imitations, was, that they were here performed in
the presence, and as it were with the permission of Mr. Kean.
There is no fear of deception in the case. The original is there in
person to answer for his identity, and ‘give the world assurance of
himself.’ The original and the copy go together, like the substance
and the shadow. But then there neither is nor can be any idea of
competition, and so far we are satisfied. In fact, Mr. Booth’s Iago
was a very close and spirited repetition of Mr. Kean’s manner of
doing that part. It was indeed the most spirited copy we ever saw
upon the stage, considering at the same time the scrupulous exactness
with which he adhered to his model in the most trifling <i>minutiæ</i>.
We need only mention as instances of similarity in the bye-play,
Mr. Booth’s mode of delivering the lines, ‘My wit comes from my
brains like birdlime,’ or his significant, and we think improper pointing
to the dead bodies, as he goes out in the last scene. The same
remarks apply to his delivery, that we made last week. He has two
voices; one his own, and the other Mr. Kean’s. His delineation of
Iago is more bustling and animated; Mr. Kean’s is more close and
cool. We suspect that Mr. Booth is not only a professed and
deliberate imitator of Mr. Kean, but that he has in general the
chameleon quality (we do not mean that of living upon air, as the
Covent-Garden Managers supposed, but) of reflecting all objects that
come in contact with him. We occasionally caught the mellow
tones of Mr. Macready rising out of the thorough-bass of Mr. Kean’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>guttural emphasis, and the flaunting, <i>degagé</i> robe of Mr. Young’s
oriental manner, flying off from the tight vest and tunic of the little
‘bony prizer’ of the Drury-Lane Company.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of Mr. Kean’s Othello we have not room to speak as it deserves,
nor have we the power if we had the room: it is beyond all praise.
Any one who has not seen him in the third act of Othello (and seen
him near) cannot have an idea of perfect tragic acting.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>March 2, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>This Theatre was a scene of the greatest confusion and uproar we
ever witnessed (not having been present at the O. P. rows) on
Tuesday evening, in consequence of the re-appearance of Mr. Booth
here, after he had entered into an engagement and performed at
Drury-Lane. For our own parts, who are but simple diplomatists,
either in theatricals or politics, the resentment and disapprobation of
the audience appear to us to have been quite well-founded. The
only fault we find with the expression of the public indignation is,
that it was directed solely against Mr. Booth, whereas the Managers
of the Theatre were entitled to the first and fullest share. Mr. Booth
may have been only <i>their</i> dupe: they have wilfully trifled with the
public, and tried to make a contemptible tool of a person belonging to
a profession by which they exist, and from which they derive all
their importance with the public. Their only excuse for inveigling
an actor whom they refused to engage, from another Theatre where he
had been engaged in consequence of such refusal, is, that by the rules
of theatrical proceeding, one theatre has no right to engage an actor
who has been in <i>treaty</i> for an engagement at the other, within a year
after the breaking off of such treaty, without leave of the Managers.
First, it appears that no such understanding exists, or is acted upon:
that the pretext, as a mere pretext, is not true: secondly, such a
mutual understanding, if it did exist, would be most unjust to the profession,
and an insult to the public. For at this rate, any Manager,
by once entering into an agreement with an actor, may keep him
dangling on his good pleasure for a year certain, may prevent his
getting any other engagement, by saying that they are still in a
progress of arrangement, though all arrangement is broken off, may
deprive an ingenious and industrious man of his bread, and the public
of the advantage of his talents, till the Managers, at the expiration of
this probationary year of non-performance, once more grant him his
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Habeas Corpus</span></i>, and release him from the restrictions and obligations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>of his non-engagement. The obvious questions for the public to
decide are these: Why, having announced Mr. Booth as a prodigy
of success after his first appearance in Richard, the Managers declined
to give Mr. Booth any but a very paltry salary? In this they either
deceived the town, or acted with injustice to Mr. Booth, because they
thought him in their power. Why, the instant he was engaged
at the other Theatre at a handsome salary, and on his own terms,
and had played there with success, they wanted to have him back,
employed threats as it should seem to induce him to return, and gave
him a larger salary than he had even obtained at Drury-Lane?
Whether, if he had not been engaged at the other theatre, they would
have engaged him at their own upon the terms to which they have
agreed to entice him back? Whether, in short, in the whole proceeding,
they have had any regard either to professional merit, or to
public gratification, or to any thing but their own cunning and self-interest?
The questions for Mr. Booth to answer are, why, after his
treatment by the Covent-Garden Company, he applied to the Drury-Lane
Company; and why, after their liberal behaviour, he deserted
back again, on the first overture, to the company that had discarded
him? Why he did not act on Saturday night, if he was able: or
at any rate, state, to prevent the charge of duplicity, his new engagement
with his old benefactors? Whether, if Mr. Booth had not
made this new arrangement, he would not have acted in spite of
indisposition or weak nerves? Lastly, whether the real motive
which led Mr. Booth to fall in so unadvisedly with the renewed and
barefaced proposals of the Covent-Garden Company, was not the
renewed hope dawning in his breast, of still signalising himself, by
dividing the town with Mr. Kean, instead of playing a second part
to him, which is all he could ever hope to do on the same theatre?
But enough of this disagreeable and disgraceful affair. The only
way to make it up with the public would be, as we are convinced, not
by attempts at vindication, but by an open apology.</p>

<div class='c019'><i>Drury-Lane.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The new farce of Frightened to Death, is the most amusing and
original piece of invention that we have seen for a long time. The
execution might be better, but the idea is good, and as far as we
know, perfectly new. Harley, Jack Phantom, in a drunken bout,
is beaten by the watch, and brought senseless to the house of his
mistress, Mrs. Orger, who, in order to cure him of his frolics,
determines to dress him up in an old wrapping-gown like a shroud,
and persuade him that he is dead. When he awakes, he at first does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>not recollect where he is: the first thing he sees is a letter from his
friend to his mistress, giving an account of his sad catastrophe, and
speaking of the manner in which order is to be taken for his burial.
Soon after, his mistress and her maid come in in mourning, lament
over his loss, and as has been agreed beforehand, take no notice of
Phantom, who in vain presents himself before them, and thus is made
to personate his own ghost. The servant, Mumps (Mr. Knight),
who is in the secret, also comes in, and staggers Phantom’s belief in
his own identity still more, by neither seeing nor hearing him. The
same machinery is played off upon him in a different mood by
Munden’s coming in, and taking him for a ghost. A very laughable
dialogue and duet here take place between the Ghost and the Ghostseer,
the latter inquiring of him with great curiosity about his
ancestors in the other world, and being desirous to cultivate an
acquaintance with the living apparition, in the hope of obtaining some
insight into the state of that state ‘from which no traveller returns.’
There was a foolish song about ‘Kisses’ at the beginning, which
excited some little displeasure, but the whole went off with great and
deserved applause.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Drury-Lane</i>) <i>April 13, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Cibber’s Comedy of the Double Gallant has been revived at this
Theatre with considerable success. Pope did Cibber a great piece of
injustice, when he appointed him to receive the crown of dullness. It
was mere spleen in Pope; and the provocation to it seems to have
been an excess of flippant vivacity in the constitution of Cibber.
That Cibber’s Birth-day Odes were dull, seems to have been the
common fault of the subject, rather than a particular objection to the
poet. In his Apology for his own Life, he is one of the most
amusing of coxcombs; happy in conscious vanity, teeming with
animal spirits, uniting the self-sufficiency of youth with the garrulity
of age; and in his plays he is not less entertaining and agreeably
familiar with the audience. His personal character predominates
indeed over the inventiveness of his muse; but so far from being dull,
he is every where light, fluttering, and airy. We could wish we had
a few more such dull fellows; they would contribute to make the
world pass away more pleasantly! Cibber, in short, though his name
has been handed down to us as a bye-word of impudent pretension by
the classical pen of his rival, who did not admit of any merit beyond
the narrow circle of wit and friendship in which he moved, was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>gentleman and a scholar of the old school; a man of wit and
pleasantry in conversation; an excellent actor; an admirable dramatic
critic; and one of the best comic writers of his age. Instead of
being a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of literature, (always excepting what is always
to be excepted, his Birth-day Odes), he had a vast deal of its spirit,
and too much of the froth. But the eye of ill-nature or prejudice,
which is attracted by the shining points of character in others,
generally transposes their good qualities, and absurdly denies them
the very excellences which excite its chagrin.—Cibber’s Careless
Husband is a master-piece of easy gaiety; and his Double Gallant,
though it cannot rank in the first, may take its place in the second
class of comedies. It is full of character, bustle, and stage-effect.
It belongs to the composite style, and very happily mixes up the
comedy of intrigue, such as we see it in Mrs. Centlivre’s Spanish
plots, with a tolerable share of the wit and sentiment of Congreve and
Vanburgh. As there is a good deal of wit, there is a spice of
wickedness in this play, which was the privilege of the good old style
of comedy, when vice, perhaps from being less common, was less
catching than it is at present. It was formerly a thing more to be
wondered at than imitated; and behind the rigid barriers of religion
and morality might be exposed freely, without the danger of any
serious practical consequences; but now that the safeguards of
wholesome prejudices are removed, we seem afraid to trust our
eyes or ears with a single situation or expression of a loose tendency,
as if the mere mention of licentiousness implied a conscious approbation
of it, and the extreme delicacy of our moral sense would
be debauched by the bare suggestion of the possibility of vice. The
luscious vein of the dialogue in many of the scenes is stopped short
in the revived play, though not before we perceive its object—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘In hidden mazes running,</div>
      <div class='line'>With wanton haste and giddy cunning!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>We noticed more than one of these <i>double meanings</i>, which however
passed off without any marks of reprobation, for unless they are made
pretty broad, the audience, from being accustomed to the cautious
purity of the modern drama, are not very expert in decyphering the
equivocal allusion.—All the characters in the Double Gallant are
very well kept up, and they were most of them well supported in the
representation. At-All and Lady Dainty are the two most prominent
characters in the original comedy, and those into which Cibber has
put most of his own nature and genius. They are the essence of
active impertinence and sickly affectation. At-All has three intrigues
upon his hands at once, and manages them all with the dexterity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>which an adept shuffles a pack of cards. His cool impudence is
equal to his wonderful vivacity. He jumps, by mere volubility of
tongue and limbs, under three several names into three several
assignations with three several <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognitas</span></i>, whom he meets at the same
house, as they happen to be mutual friends. He would succeed with
them all, but that he is detected by them all round, and then he can
hardly be said to fail, for he carries off the best of them at last
(Mrs. Mardyn), who not being able to seduce him from her rivals
by any other means, resorts to a disguise, and vanquishes him in love
by disarming him in a duel. The scene in which At-All, who had
made love to Clorinda as Colonel Standfast, is introduced to her
by her cousin (who is also in love with him) as Mr. Freeman, and
while he is disowning his personal identity, is surprised by the arrival
of Lady Sadlife, to whom he had been making the same irresistible
overtures, is one of the best <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’œils</span></i> of the theatre we have seen
for a long time. Harley acts this character laughably, but not very
judiciously. He bustles through it with the liveliness of a footman,
not with the manners of a gentleman. He never changes his
character with his dress, but still he is a pleasant fellow in himself,
and is so happy in the applause he receives, that we are sorry to find
any fault with him. Mrs. Alsop’s Lady Dainty was a much better,
but a much less agreeable piece of acting. The affected sensibility,
the pretended disorders, the ridiculous admiration of novelty, and the
languid caprices of this character, were given by the actress with an
overpowering truth of effect. The mixture of folly, affectation,
pride, insensibility, and spleen which constitute the character of the
fine lady, as it existed in the days of Cibber, and is delineated in this
comedy, is hardly to be tolerated in itself, with every advantage of
grace, youth, beauty, dress, and fashion. But Mrs. Alsop gave only
the inherent vice and ridiculous folly of the character, without any
external accomplishments to conceal or adorn it. She has always
the same painful ‘frontlet’ on: the same uneasy expression of face
and person. Her affected distortions seemed to arise from real pain;
nor was her delight in mischief and absurdity counteracted by any
palliating circumstances of elegance or beauty. A character of this
description ought <i>only</i> to appeal to the understanding, and not to
offend the senses. We do not know how to soften this censure; but
we will add, that Mrs. Alsop, in all her characters, shews sense,
humour, and spirit.</p>

<p class='c021'>Dowton and Miss Kelly, as Sir Solomon Sadlife and Wishwell,
are two for a pair. We do not wish to see a better actor or actress.
The effect which both these performers produce, is the best and
strongest that can be, because they never try to produce an effect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Their style of acting is the reverse of grimace or caricature. They
never overcharge or force any thing, and their humour is so much
the more irresistible in its appeal, as it seems to come from them in
spite of themselves. Instead of wanting to shew their talents to the
audience, they seem hardly conscious of them themselves. All their
excellence is natural, unaffected, involuntary. When the sense of
absurdity is so strong that it cannot be contained any longer, it bursts
out; and the expression of their feelings commands our sympathy,
because they do not appear to court it. Their nature is downright
sturdy, sterling, good old English nature, that is, the sort of nature
that we like best. In the present play, it is hard to determine which
is the best—Miss Kelly’s sulky suppressed abigail airs as Wishwell,
her adroit irony and contemptuous expression of pity for Sir Solomon’s
credulity, or Dowton’s deliberate manner of digesting his disgraces,
chewing the cud of his misfortunes, and pocketing up his branching
horns, in the latter character. Wishwell’s tingling fingers, uplifted
eyes, pouting mouth, bridling chin, and Sir Solomon’s bronzed face,
curling lips, blank looks, nods, winks, and shrugs, told their own
story and kept their own secret (to themselves), as well as heart could
wish. We have a stronger relish for this kind of dry pungent
humour, than we have for the taste of olives.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Inn-keeper’s Daughter is a melo-drame founded on Mr.
Southey’s ballad of Mary the Maid of the Inn. The ballad is better
than the melo-drame. The interest of the story is less in the latter,
and the machinery is complicated, and moves slow.</p>

<p class='c021'>Robinson Crusoe, the new melo-drame at Covent-Garden, is <i>not</i>
the old favourite with the public. It has not the striking incident of
the notched post, nor of the print of a human footstep in the sand;
but there is a poodle dog in it, and innumerable savages, English
and Caribbee.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>King’s Theatre</i>) <i>April 20, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Mozart’s celebrated Opera of Don Juan has been brought forward
at this Theatre with every attraction, and with all the success which
could be anticipated. The house was crowded to excess on Saturday
week (the day of its being first brought out): on Tuesday it was but
thinly attended. Why was this? Was it because the first representation
did not answer the expectation of the public? No; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>because Saturday is the fashionable day for going to the Opera, and
Tuesday is not. On Saturday, therefore, the English are a musical
public; and on Tuesday they are not a musical public: on Saturday
they are all rapture and enthusiasm; and on Tuesday they are all
coldness and indifference,—impose a periodical penance on themselves
for the plenary indulgence of their last week’s ecstasies, and have
their ears hermetically sealed to the charms of modulated sounds.
Yet the writer of the preface to the translation of Don Juan assures
us, that ‘the people of this country who frequent the Opera, are
inferior to those of no other nation in their taste for fine music.’
That may be so. But still we doubt, if Don Juan, ‘the matchless
work of its immortalized author,’ had been presented to the English
public for the first time on Saturday week, without those wonderful
helps to public taste and discernment, the name and reputation of the
composer, whether it would have met with any better success than it
did in Prague in 1787, or at Paris some years after, and whether we
might not have had to observe of its representation at the King’s
Theatre, as Gerat, the singer, did of its representation at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Academie
de Musique</cite>; <cite>Don Juan a paru incognito à l’Opera</cite></span>! The only convincing
proof that the public, either in this country or on the
Continent, are become more alive to ‘the refined and intellectual
music’ of Don Giovanni than they were thirty years ago, is—that
the author is dead.</p>

<p class='c021'>What inclines us the more to believe that the admiration of
Mozart’s music in this instance is more a thing of rote than the
consequence of any general feeling on the subject, is, that we hear
of nothing but the sublimity and Shakespearian character of Don
Juan. Now we confess that, with the single exception of the Ghost
scene, we not only do not feel any such general character of grand
or strongly-contrasted expression pervading the composition, but we
do not see any opportunity for it. Except the few words put into
the mouth of the great Commander (Don Pedro) either as the
horseman ghost, or the spectre-guest of Don Juan, which break
upon the ear with a sort of awful murmur, like the sound of the
last trumpet ringing in the hollow chambers of the dead, but which
yet are so managed, that ‘airs from heaven’ seem mingled with
‘blasts from hell,’ the rest of the Opera is scarcely any thing but
gaiety, tenderness, and sweetness, from the first line to the last. To
be sure, the part of the great Commander is a striking and lofty
catastrophe to the piece; he does in some sort assume a voice of
stern authority, which puts an end to the mirth, the dancing, the
love and feasting, and drowns the sounds of the pipe, the lute, and
the guitar, in a burst of rattling thunder; but even this thunder falls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>and is caught among its own echoes, that soften while they redouble
the sound, and by its distant and varied accompaniment, soothes as
much as it startles the ear. This short episode, which is included
in four or five sentences printed in capital letters, is the only part of
the opera which aims at the tragic: this part is not of a pure or
unmixed species, but is very properly harmonised with the rest of
the composition, by middle and reflected tones; and all the other
scenes are of one uniform, but exquisite character, a profusion of
delicate airs and graces. Except, then, where the author reluctantly
gives place to the Ghost-statue, or rather compromises matters with
him, this opera is Mozart all over; it is no more like Shakespear,
than Claude Lorraine is like Rubens or Michael Angelo. It is
idle to make the comparison. The personal character of the
composer’s mind, a light, airy, voluptuous spirit, is infused into
every line of it; the intoxication of pleasure, the sunshine of hope,
the dancing of the animal spirits, the bustle of action, the sinkings
of tenderness and pity, are there, but nothing else. It is a kind
of scented music; the ear imbibes an aromatic flavour from the
sounds. It is like the breath of flowers; the sighing of balmy
winds; or Zephyr with Flora playing; or the liquid notes of the
nightingale wafted to the bosom of the bending rose. To show
at once our taste or the want of it, the song of ‘La ci darem’ gives
us, we confess, both in itself, and from the manner in which it is
sung by Madame Fodor, more pleasure than all the rest of the
opera put together. We could listen to this air for ever—with
certain intervals: the first notes give a throb of expectation to the
heart, the last linger on the sense. We <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</span></i> it greedily, with a
sort of childish impatience for new delight, and drink in the ethereal
sounds, like draughts of earthly nectar. The heart is intoxicated
through the ear; and feels in the tremulous accents of Zerlina’s
voice, all the varying emotions of tenderness, of doubt, of regret,
and giddy rapture, as she resigns herself to her new lover. Madame
Fodor’s execution of her part of this duet was excellent. There
is a clear, firm, silvery tone in her voice, like the reverberation of
a tight-strung instrument, which by its contrast gives a peculiar effect
to the more melting and subdued expression of particular passages,
and which accords admirably with the idea of high health and
spirits in the rustic character of Zerlina. We are tempted to say
of her in this character, what Spenser says of Belphebe,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>‘——And when she spake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sweet words like dropping honey she did shed,</div>
      <div class='line'>And ’twixt the pearls and rubies softly brake</div>
      <div class='line'>A silver sound, that heav’nly music seem’d to make.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>She was less successful in the execution of the song to Massetto
just after, ‘Batte, batte, Massetto:’ for she seemed to sing it as if
she had hardly learned it by heart. To this, however, she gave a
characteristic simplicity of expression; she appeared in the first part
as if she would willingly stand like a lamb, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">come agnellina</span></i>, to be
beaten by her provoked lover, and afterwards, when she is reconciled
to him, as if she was glad she had escaped a beating. Her song,
<cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Vedrai carino</span></cite>, promising him a remedy, when Massetto himself
gets beaten, by offering him her heart, was charming, both from
the execution of the air, and from the action with which she accompanied
it.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of the other performers we cannot speak so favourably. Signor
Ambrogetti gave considerable life and spirit to the part of Don
Giovanni; but we neither saw the dignified manners of the Spanish
nobleman, nor the insinuating address of the voluptuary. He makes
too free and violent a use of his legs and arms. He sung the air,
<cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Finche dal vino</span></cite>, in which he anticipates an addition to his list of
mistresses from the success of his entertainment, with a sort of
jovial turbulent vivacity, but without the least ‘sense of amorous
delight.’ His only object seemed to be, to sing the words as loud
and as fast as possible. Nor do we think he gave to Don Juan’s
serenade, <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Deh vieni alla finestra</span></cite>, any thing like the spirit of fluttering
apprehension and tenderness which characterises the original music.
Signor Ambrogetti’s manner of acting in this scene was that of the
successful and significant intriguer, but not of an intriguer—in love.
Sensibility should be the ground-work of the expression: the cunning
and address are only accessories.</p>

<p class='c021'>Naldi’s Laporello was much admired, and it was not without its
merits, though we cannot say that it gave us much pleasure. His
humour is coarse and boisterous, and is more that of a buffoon than
a comic actor. He treats the audience with the same easy cavalier
airs that an impudent waiter at a French table-d’hôte does the guests
as they arrive. The gross familiarity of his behaviour to Donna
Elvira, in the song where he makes out the list of his master’s
mistresses, was certainly not in character; nor is there any thing in
the words or the music to justify it. The tone and air which he
should assume are those of pretended sympathy, mixed with involuntary
laughter, not of wanton undisguised insult.</p>

<p class='c021'>Signor Crivelli and Madame Camporese did not add any particular
prominence to the serious parts of Don Octavio, and Donna Anna.
Signora Hughes’s Donna Elvira was successful beyond what we
could have supposed. This lady at the Italian Opera is respectable:
on the English stage she was formidable. Signor Angrisani <i>doubles</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>the part of Massetto and the Ghost. In the former, he displayed
much drollery and <i>naiveté</i>; and in the latter, he was as solemn,
terrific, and mysterious as a ghost should be. A new translation
accompanies the Opera House edition of Don Giovanni. It is very
well executed. But as it is not in verse, it might have been more
literal, without being less elegant.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>April 27, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The Conquest of Taranto continues to be acted here with a
success proportionate to its merits. It is from the pen of Mr.
Dimond, whose productions are well known to the public, and
which have so strong a family-likeness, that from having seen any
one of them, we may form a tolerably correct idea of the rest.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex uno omnes.</span></i> His pieces have upon the whole been exceedingly
popular, and we think deservedly so; for they have all the merit
that belongs to the style of the drama to which he has devoted his
talents,—a style which is a great favourite with an immense majority
of the play-going public. This style may be called the <i>purely
romantic</i>; there is little or nothing classical in it. The author does
not profess to provide a public entertainment at his own entire
expense, and from his own proper funds, but contracts with the
managers to get up a striking and impressive exhibition in conjunction
with the scene-painter, the scene-shifter, the musical
composer, the orchestra, the choruses on the stage, and the <i>lungs</i>
of the actors! It is a kind of <i>pic-nic</i> contribution, to which we sit
down with a good appetite, and from which we come away quite
satisfied, though our attention is somewhat distracted in the multitude
of objects to which our gratitude is due for the pleasure we have
received. The art of the romantic dramatist seems to be, to put
ordinary characters in extraordinary situations, and to blend commonplace
sentiments with picturesque scenery. The highest pathos is
ushered in, and the mind prepared to indulge in all the luxury of
woe, by the chaunting of music behind the scenes, as the blowing
up of a mine of gunpowder gives the finishing stroke to the progress
of the passions. The approach of a hero is announced by a blast
of trumpets; the flute and flageolet breathe out the whole soul of
the lover. Mr. Dimond is by no means jealous of the exclusive
honours of the Tragic Muse; he is not at all disposed to make a
monopoly of wit, genius, or reputation: he minds little but the
conducting of his story to the end of the third act, and loses no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>opportunity of playing the game into the hands of his theatrical
associates, so that they may supply his deficiencies, and all together
produce a perfect piece. In the Conquest of Taranto the scene
lies almost the whole time upon the beautiful sea-coast of Spain, and
we do not feel the lack of descriptive poetry, while the eye is
regaled with one continued panorama. In a word, the author
resembles those painters of history who pay more attention to their
back-ground than their figures, to costume and drapery than to the
expression of thought and sentiment.</p>

<p class='c021'>The romantic drama, such as we have here described it, admits
of various gradations, from the point where it unites with the pure
tragic down to the melo-drame, and speaking pantomime, nor do
we think that as it descends lower in its pretensions, its interest
necessarily grows less. Where the regular drama studiously avails
itself of the assistance of other arts, as painting and music, where
the dialogue becomes the vehicle for connecting scenery, pantomime,
and song in one dazzling and overpowering appeal to all our different
faculties and senses, we are satisfied if the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> produces its
effect, and do not enquire whether the work of the author alone, in
a literary point of view, is proof against criticism. He is supposed
to write for the stage ‘with all appliances and means to boot,’ not
for the loneliness of the closet, and is little more than the ballet-master
of the scene. He is not to enter into a competition with his
assistants in the several departments of his art, but to avail himself of
their resources. In the division of labour it is ridiculous to expect
the same person to do the whole work. This would be double toil
and trouble, and would, besides, answer no end. An appeal to the
understanding or the imagination is superfluous, where the senses are
assailed on all sides. What is the use of painting a landscape
twice—to the ear as well as to the eye? What signify ‘the golden
cadences of verse,’ when only employed to usher in a song? The
gleams of wit or fancy glimmer but feebly on a stage blazing with
phosphorus; and surely the Tragic Muse need not strain her voice
so deep or high, while a poodle dog is barking fit to break his heart,
in the most affecting part of the performance. We cannot attend
to sounding epithets while a castle is tumbling about our ears, and
it is sufficiently alarming to see an infant thrown from a precipice or
hanging bridge into the foaming waves—reflections apart. Commonplace
poetry is good enough as an accompaniment to all this; as very
indifferent words are equally well set to the finest tunes.—So far
then from joining in the common cry against Mr. Dimond’s poetry
as not rising above mediocrity, we should be sorry if he wrote better
than he does. And what confirms us in this sentiment is, that those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>who have tried to do better have succeeded worse. The most
ambitious writers of the modern romantic drama are Mr. Coleridge
and Mr. Maturin. But in the Remorse of the one, all Mr.
Coleridge’s metaphysics are lost in moonshine; and in Bertram and
Don Manuel, the genius of poetry crowned with faded flowers, and
seated on the top of some high Gothic battlement, in vain breathes
its votive accents amidst the sighing of the forest gale and the vespers
of midnight monks. But enough of this.</p>

<p class='c021'>There is considerable interest in the outline of the present play,
and the events are ingeniously and impressively connected together,
so as to excite and keep alive curiosity, and to produce striking
situations. But to this production of external effect, character and
probability are repeatedly sacrificed, and the actions which the
different persons are made to perform, like stage-puppets, have no
adequate motives. For instance, it is quite out of our common
calculation of human nature, that Valencia (Mr. Macready) should
betray his country to an enemy, because he is jealous of a rival in
love; nor is there any thing in the previous character of Valencia to
lead us to expect such an extreme violation of common sense and
decency. Again, Rinaldo is betrayed to his dishonour, by acting
contrary to orders and to his duty as a knight, at the first insidious
suggestion of Valencia. The entrance of the Moors through the
subterranean passage, and the blowing up of the palace while the
court are preparing to give a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête champêtre</span></i> in the middle of
a siege, is not only surprising but ridiculous. Great praise is due
to Mr. Young as Aben Hamet, to Mr. Macready as Valencia, and
to Mr. Booth as Rinaldo, for the force of their action, and the
audibleness of their delivery:—perhaps for something more.—Miss
Stephens, as Oriana’s maid, sang several songs very prettily.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Drury-Lane</i>) <i>May 11, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kenney’s new Comedy called the Touch-stone, or the World
as it goes, has been acted here with great success. It possesses
much liveliness and pleasantry in the incidents, and the dialogue is
neat and pointed. The interest never flags, and is never wound up
to a painful pitch. There are several <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coups de théatre</span></i>, which shew
that Mr. Kenney is an adept in his art, and has the stage and the
actors before him while he is writing in his closet. The character
of Dinah Cropley, which is admirably sustained by Miss Kelly, is
the chief attraction of the piece. The author has contrived situations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>for this pretty little rustic, which bring out the exquisite <i>naiveté</i> and
simple pathos of the actress in as great a degree as we ever saw them.
Mr. Kenney, we understand, wrote this Comedy abroad; and there
is a foreign air of homely contentment and natural gaiety about the
character of poor Dinah, like the idea we have of Marivaux’s
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paysanne parvenue</span></i>. She seemed to have fed her chickens and
turned her spinning-wheel in France, under more genial and better-tempered
skies. Perhaps, however, this may be a mere prejudice
in our minds, arising from our having lately seen Miss Kelly in such
characters taken from French pieces. Her lover, Harley, (Peregrine
Paragon), is of undoubted home growth. He is a very romantic,
generous, amorous sort of simpleton, while he is poor; and for want
of knowing better, thinks himself incorruptible, till temptation falls
in his way, and then he turns out a very knave: and only saves his
credit in the end by one of those <i>last act</i> repentances which are more
pleasing than probable. He is in the first instance a poor country
schoolmaster, who is engaged to marry Dinah Cropley, the daughter
of a neighbouring farmer. They cannot, however, obtain the consent
of their landlord and his sister (Holland and Mrs. Harlowe), the
one a town coquette, the other a commercial gambler; when just in
the nick of time, news is brought that Holland is ruined by the
failure of an extravagant speculation, and that a distant relation has
left his whole fortune to Harley. The tables are now turned.
Harley buys the mansion-house, furniture, and gardens, takes
possession of them with highly amusing airs of upstart vanity and
self-importance; is flattered by the Squire’s sister, who discards and
is discarded by a broken fortune-hunting lover of the name of Garnish
(Wallack), makes proposals of marriage to her, and thinks no more
of his old favourite Dinah. Garnish in the mean time finding the
pliability of temper of Peregrine Paragon, Esq., and to make up for
his disappointment in his own fortune-hunting scheme, sends for his
sister (Mrs. Alsop) whom he introduces to the said Peregrine
Paragon. The forward pretensions of the two new candidates for
his hand, form an amusing contrast with the sanguine hopes and
rejected addresses of the old possessor of his heart, and some very
ridiculous scenes take place, with one very affecting one, in which
Miss Kelly makes a last vain appeal to her lover’s fidelity, and
(Oxberry) her father watches the result with a mute wonderment
and disappointed expectation infinitely natural, and well worth any
body’s seeing. By-and-bye it turns out that the fortune has been
left not to Harley, but by a subsequent will to Miss Kelly, who is
also a relation of the deceased, when instantly his two accomplished
mistresses give over their persecution of him, their two brothers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>set off to make love to the new heiress, who exposes them both to
the ridicule they deserve, and Harley, without knowing of the
change of fortune, is moved by a letter he receives from her, to
repent just in time to prove himself not altogether unworthy of her
hand.</p>

<p class='c021'>Such is the outline of this Comedy. Dowton acts the part of a
friendly mediator, and spectator in the scene; and Hughes makes
a very fit representative of a shuffling, officious, pettifogging attorney.
The most unpleasant part of the play was the undisguised mercenary
profligacy of the four characters of Wallack, Holland, Mrs. Alsop,
and Mrs. Harlowe: and a precious <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">partie quarrée</span></i> they are. The
scrapes into which their folly and cunning lead them are, however,
very amusing, and their unprincipled selfishness is very deservedly
punished at last.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>May 25, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The Libertine, an after-piece altered from Shadwell’s play of that
name, and founded on the story of Don Juan, with Mozart’s music,
was represented here on Tuesday evening. Almost every thing else
was against it, but the music triumphed. Still it had but half a
triumph, for the songs were not <i>encored</i>; and when an attempt was
made by some rash over-weening enthusiasts to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</span></i> the enchanting
airs of Mozart, that heavy German composer, ‘that dull Beotian
genius,’ as he has been called by a lively verbal critic of our times,
the English, disdaining this insult offered to our native talents,
<i>hissed</i>—in the plenitude of their pampered grossness, and ‘ignorant
impatience’ of foreign refinement and elegance, they hissed! We
believe that unconscious patriotism has something to do with this as
well as sheer stupidity: they think that a real taste for the Fine Arts,
unless they are of British growth and manufacture, is a sign of disaffection
to the Government, and that there must be ‘something
rotten in the state of Denmark,’ if their ears, as well as their hearts,
are not true English. We have heard sailors’ songs by Little Smith,
and Yorkshire songs by Emery, and the Death of Nelson by Mr.
Sinclair, <i>encored</i> again and again at Covent-Garden, so as almost ‘to
split the ears of the groundlings,’ yet the other night they would not
hear of <i>encoring</i> Miss Stephens, either in the Duet with Duruset, <i>La
ci darem</i>, nor in the song appealing for his forgiveness, <i>Batte, Massetto</i>;
yet at the Opera they tolerate Madame Fodor in repeating both these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>songs, because they suppose it to be the etiquette, and would have
you believe that they do not very warmly insist on the repetition of
the last song she sings there, out of tenderness to the actress, not to
spare their own ears, which are soon cloyed with sweetness, and
delight in nothing but noise and fury.</p>

<p class='c021'>We regard Miss Stephens’s Zerlina as a failure, whether we
compare her with Madame Fodor in the same part, or with herself
in other parts. She undoubtedly sung her songs with much sweetness
and simplicity, but her simplicity had something of insipidity in
it; her tones wanted the fine, rich, <i>pulpy</i> essence of Madame Fodor’s,
the elastic impulse of health and high animal spirits; nor had her
manner of giving the different airs that laughing, careless grace which
gives to Madame Fodor’s singing all the ease and spirit of conversation.
There was some awkwardness necessarily arising from the
transposition of the songs, particularly of the duet between Zerlina
and Don Giovanni, which was given to Massetto, because Mr. Charles
Kemble is not a singer, and which by this means lost its exquisite
appropriateness of expression. Of Mr. Duruset’s Massetto we shall
only say, that it is not so good as Angrisani’s. He would however
have made a better representative of the statue of Don Pedro than
Mr. Chapman, who is another gentleman who has not ‘a singing
face,’ and whom it would therefore have been better to leave out
of the Opera than the songs; particularly than that fine one,
answering to <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Di rider finira pria della Aurora</span></i>, which Mr. Chapman
was mounted on horseback on purpose, it should seem, <i>neither to
sing nor say!</i></p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Charles Kemble did not play the Libertine well. Instead of
the untractable, fiery spirit, the unreclaimable licentiousness of Don
Giovanni, he was as tame as any saint;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And of his port as meek as is a maid.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>He went through the different exploits of wickedness assigned him
with evident marks of reluctance and contrition; and it seemed the
height of injustice that so well meaning a young man, forced into acts
of villainy against his will, should at last be seized upon as their lawful
prize by fiends come hot from hell with flaming torches, and that
he should sink into a lake of burning brimstone on a splendid car
brought to receive him by the devil, in the likeness of a great dragon,
writhing round and round upon a wheel of fire—an exquisite device
of the Managers, superadded to the original story, and in striking
harmony with Mozart’s music! Mr. Liston’s Leporello was not
quite what we wished it. He played it in a mixed style between a
burlesque imitation of the Italian Opera, and his own <i>inimitable</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>manner. We like him best when he is his own great original, and
copies only himself—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

      <div class='line'>‘None but himself can be his parallel.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>He did not sing the song of Madamira half so well, nor with half the
impudence of Naldi. Indeed, all the performers seemed, instead of
going their lengths on the occasion, to be upon their good behaviour,
and instead of entering into their parts, to be thinking of the comparison
between themselves and the performers at the Opera. We
cannot say it was in their favour.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kean had for his benefit on Monday, Barbarossa, and the
musical after-piece of Paul and Virginia. In the tragedy there was
nothing for him to do, and it is only when there is nothing for him

disguise as a slave, and declares himself to be Achmet, the heir to
the throne, which Barbarossa has usurped by the murder of his father,
was the only one of any effect. We are sorry that Mr. Kean repeats
this character <i>till further notice</i>. In Paul we liked him exceedingly:
but we should have liked him better, if he had displayed fewer of the
graces and intricacies of the art. The tremulous deliberation with
which he introduced some of these ornamental flourishes, put us a

<p class='c022'>As Mr. Bickerstaff, who was applied to by the poet, declined
deciding on this nice point, so we shall not decide whether Mr. Kean
sung well or ill, but leave it to be settled by the connoisseurs and the
ladies. His voice is clear, full, and sweet to a degree of tenderness.
Miss Mangeon played Virginia, and in so doing, did not spoil one of
the most pleasing recollections of our boyish reading days, which we
have still treasured up ‘in our heart’s core, aye, in our best of hearts.’</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>June 8, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Mrs. Siddons’s appearance in Lady Macbeth at this Theatre on
Thursday, drew immense crowds to every part of the house. We
should suppose that more than half the number of persons were compelled
to return without gaining admittance. We succeeded in
gaining a seat in one of the back-boxes, and saw this wonderful
performance at a distance, and consequently at a disadvantage.
Though the distance of place is a disadvantage to a performance like
Mrs. Siddons’s Lady Macbeth, we question whether the distance of
time at which we have formerly seen it is any. It is nearly twenty
years since we first saw her in this character, and certainly the
impression which we have still left on our minds from that first
exhibition, is stronger than the one we received the other evening.
The sublimity of Mrs. Siddons’s acting is such, that the first impulse
which it gives to the mind can never wear out, and we doubt whether
this original and paramount impression is not weakened, rather than
strengthened, by subsequent repetition. We do not read the tragedy
of the Robbers twice; if we have seen Mrs. Siddons in Lady
Macbeth only once, it is enough. The impression is stamped there
for ever, and any after-experiments and critical enquiries only serve
to fritter away and tamper with the sacredness of the early recollection.
We see into the details of the character, its minute excellencies
or defects, but the great masses, the gigantic proportions, are in some
degree lost upon us by custom and familiarity. It is the first blow
that staggers us; by gaining time we recover our self-possession.
Mrs. Siddons’s Lady Macbeth is little less appalling in its effects than
the apparition of a preternatural being; but if we were accustomed
to see a preternatural being constantly, our astonishment would by
degrees diminish.</p>

<p class='c021'>We do not know whether it is owing to the cause here stated, or
to a falling-off in Mrs. Siddons’s acting, but we certainly thought her
performance the other night inferior to what it used to be. She
speaks too slow, and her manner has not that decided, sweeping
majesty, which used to characterise her as the Muse of Tragedy
herself. Something of apparent indecision is perhaps attributable to
the circumstance of her only acting at present on particular occasions.
An actress who appears only once a-year cannot play so well as if she
was in the habit of acting once a-week. We therefore wish Mrs.
Siddons would either return to the stage, or retire from it altogether.
By her present uncertain wavering between public and private life, she
may diminish her reputation, while she can add nothing to it.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Drury-Lane</i>) <i>September 26, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Maywood, from the Theatre Royal Glasgow, of whom report
had spoken highly, and we think not undeservedly so, appeared here
in the part of Shylock. He was received throughout with very
great applause; nor was there any part of his performance at which
the slightest disapprobation was expressed. His figure is rather
short; his face, though not regularly formed, expressive; his voice
full, and capable of great depth of intonation; his attitudes firm and
well conceived: the most spirited scene, we thought, was that in
which Tubal brings him information of Antonio’s losses and impending
ruin, and of his daughter’s waste of his money. His exclamation,
‘Thank God! thank God!’ on hearing of the shipwreck, was as
animated as any thing we ever heard. In the last scene, the glare of
malignity with which he eyed Antonio after his defeated revenge
recoils upon his own head, was truly terrific. Upon the whole, we
consider this gentleman as an acquisition to the tragic strength of the
theatre; and are persuaded that what seemed the principal defect in
his performance, an occasional want of decision of tone, and firmness
of action, was attributable only to that diffidence which is natural to
a young actor on his first appearance before a London audience, in a
part of so much prominence, and which has been so ably filled of
late.</p>

<div class='c019'>(<i>Covent Garden</i>) <i>June 25, 1817.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kemble took his leave of the Stage on Monday night, in the
character of Coriolanus. On his first coming forward to pronounce
his Farewell Address, he was received with a shout like thunder:
on his retiring after it, the applause was long before it subsided
entirely away. There is something in these partings with old public
favourites exceedingly affecting. They teach us the shortness of
human life, and the vanity of human pleasures. Our associations of
admiration and delight with theatrical performers, are among our
earliest recollections—among our last regrets. They are links that
connect the beginning and the end of life together; <i>their</i> bright and
giddy career of popularity measures the arch that spans our brief
existence. It is near twenty years ago since we first saw Mr. Kemble
in the same character—yet how short the interval seems! The
impression appears as distinct as if it were of yesterday. In fact,
intellectual objects, in proportion as they are lasting, may be said to
shorten life. Time has no effect upon them. The petty and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>personal, that which appeals to our senses and our interests, is by
degrees forgotten, and fades away into the distant obscurity of the
past. The grand and the ideal, that which appeals to the imagination,
can only perish with it, and remains with us, unimpaired in its
lofty abstraction, from youth to age; as, wherever we go, we still
see the same heavenly bodies shining over our heads! We forget
numberless things that have happened to ourselves, one generation of
follies after another; but not the first time of our seeing Mr. Kemble,
nor shall we easily forget the last! Coriolanus, the character in
which he took his leave of the Stage, was one of the first in which
we remember to have seen him; and it was one in which we were
not sorry to part with him, for we wished to see him appear like himself
to the last. Nor was he wanting to himself on this occasion: he
played the part as well as he ever did—with as much freshness and
vigour. There was no abatement of spirit and energy—none of grace
and dignity: his look, his action, his expression of the character,
were the same as they ever were: they could not be finer. It is
mere cant, to say that Mr. Kemble has quite fallen off of late—that
he is not what he was: he may have fallen off in the opinion of some
jealous admirers, because he is no longer in exclusive possession of
the Stage: but in himself he has not fallen off a jot. Why then do
we approve of his retiring? Because we do not wish him to wait till
it is <i>necessary</i> for him to retire. On the last evening, he displayed
the same excellences, and gave the same prominence to the very same
passages, that he used to do. We might refer to his manner of doing
obeisance to his mother in the triumphal procession in the second act,
and to the scene with Aufidius in the last act, as among the most
striking instances. The action with which he accompanied the proud
taunt to Aufidius—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like an eagle in a dove-cote, I</div>
      <div class='line'>Flutter’d your Volscians in Corioli;</div>
      <div class='line'>Alone I did it——’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>gave double force and beauty to the image. Again, where he waits
for the coming of Aufidius in his rival’s house, he stood at the foot
of the statue of Mars, himself another Mars! In the reconciliation
scene with his mother, which is the finest in the play, he was not
equally impressive. Perhaps this was not the fault of Mr. Kemble,
but of the stage itself, which can hardly do justice to such thoughts
and sentiments as here occur:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——My mother bows:</div>
      <div class='line'>As if Olympus to a mole-hill should</div>
      <div class='line'>In supplication nod.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>Mr. Kemble’s voice seemed to faint and stagger, to be strained
and cracked, under the weight of this majestic image: but, indeed,
we know of no tones deep or full enough to bear along the swelling
tide of sentiment it conveys; nor can we conceive any thing in
outward form to answer to it, except when Mrs. Siddons played the
part of Volumnia.</p>

<p class='c021'>We may on this occasion be expected to say a few words on the
general merits of Mr. Kemble as an actor, and on the principal
characters he performed; in doing which, we shall</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——Nothing extenuate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor set down aught in malice.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>It has always appeared to us, that the range of characters in which
Mr. Kemble more particularly shone, and was superior to every other
actor, were those which consisted in the developement of some one
solitary sentiment or exclusive passion. From a want of rapidity, of
scope, and variety, he was often deficient in expressing the bustle and
complication of different interests; nor did he possess the faculty of
overpowering the mind by sudden and irresistible bursts of passion:
but in giving the habitual workings of a predominant feeling, as in
Penruddock, or The Stranger, in Coriolanus, Cato, and some others,
where all the passions move round a central point, and are governed
by one master-key, he stood unrivalled. Penruddock, in The Wheel
of Fortune, was one of his most correct and interesting performances,
and one of the most perfect on the modern stage. The deeply-rooted,
mild, pensive melancholy of the character, its embittered recollections,
and dignified benevolence, were conveyed by Mr. Kemble with
equal truth, elegance, and feeling. In The Stranger, again, which is
in fact the same character, he brooded over the recollection of disappointed
hope till it became a part of himself; it sunk deeper into
his mind the longer he dwelt upon it; his regrets only became more
profound as they became more durable. His person was moulded to
the character. The weight of sentiment which oppressed him was
never suspended: the spring at his heart was never lightened—it
seemed as if his whole life had been a suppressed sigh! So in
Coriolanus, he exhibited the ruling passion with the same unshaken
firmness, he preserved the same haughty dignity of demeanour, the
same energy of will, and unbending sternness of temper throughout.
He was swayed by a single impulse. His tenaciousness of purpose
was only irritated by opposition; he turned neither to the right nor
the left; the vehemence with which he moved forward increasing
every instant, till it hurried him on to the catastrophe. In Leontes,
also, in The Winter’s Tale (a character he at one time played often),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>the growing jealousy of the King, and the exclusive possession which
this passion gradually obtains over his mind, were marked by him in
the finest manner, particularly where he exclaims—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘——Is whispering nothing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?</div>
      <div class='line'>Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career</div>
      <div class='line'>Of laughter with a sigh (a note infallible</div>
      <div class='line'>Of breaking honesty)? Horsing foot on foot?</div>
      <div class='line'>Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?</div>
      <div class='line'>Hours minutes? The noon midnight? and all eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Blind with the pin and web, but their’s; their’s only,</div>
      <div class='line'>That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?</div>
      <div class='line'>Why then the world and that’s in ‘t is nothing,</div>
      <div class='line'>The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia’s nothing,</div>
      <div class='line'>My wife is nothing, if this be nothing!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>In the course of this enumeration, every proof told stronger, and
followed with quicker and harder strokes; his conviction became
more rivetted at every step of his progress; and at the end, his mind,
and ‘every corporal agent,’ appeared wound up to a phrenzy of
despair. In such characters, Mr. Kemble had no occasion to call to
his aid either the resources of invention, or the tricks of the art: his
success depended on the increasing intensity with which he dwelt on
a given feeling, or enforced a passion that resisted all interference or
control.</p>

<p class='c021'>In Hamlet, on the contrary, Mr. Kemble in our judgment
unavoidably failed from a want of flexibility, of that quick sensibility
which yields to every motive, and is borne away with every breath of
fancy, which is distracted in the multiplicity of its reflections, and lost
in the uncertainty of its resolutions. There is a perpetual undulation
of feeling in the character of Hamlet; but in Mr. Kemble’s acting,
‘there was neither variableness nor shadow of turning.’ He played
it like a man in armour, with a determined inveteracy of purpose, in
one undeviating straight line, which is as remote from the natural
grace and indolent susceptibility of the character, as the sharp angles
and abrupt starts to produce an effect which Mr. Kean throws into it.</p>

<p class='c021'>In King John, which was one of Mr. Kemble’s most admired
parts, the transitions of feeling, though just and powerful, were prepared
too long beforehand, and were too long in executing to produce
their full effect. The actor seemed waiting for some complicated
machinery to enable him to make his next movement, instead of
trusting to the true impulses of passion. There was no sudden collision
of opposite elements; the golden flash of genius was not there;
‘the fire i’ th’ flint was cold,’ for it was not struck. If an image
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>could be constructed by magic art to play King John, it would play
it in much the same manner that Mr. Kemble played it.</p>

<p class='c021'>In Macbeth, Mr. Kemble was unequal to ‘the tug and war’ of
the passions which assail him: he stood as it were at bay with fortune,
and maintained his ground too steadily against ‘fate and metaphysical
aid;’ instead of staggering and reeling under the appalling visions of
the preternatural world, and having his frame wrenched from all the
holds and resting places of his will, by the stronger power of imagination.
In the latter scenes, however, he displayed great energy and
spirit; and there was a fine melancholy retrospective tone in his
manner of delivering the lines,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘My way of life has fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>which smote upon the heart, and remained there ever after. His
Richard <span class='fss'>III.</span> wanted that tempest and whirlwind of the soul, that life
and spirit, and dazzling rapidity of motion, which fills the stage, and
burns in every part of it, when Mr. Kean performs this character.
To Mr. Kean’s acting in general, we might apply the lines of the
poet, where he describes</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The fiery soul that, working out its way,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fretted the pigmy body to decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>And o’er-inform’d the tenement of clay.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Mr. Kemble’s manner, on the contrary, had always something dry,
hard, and pedantic in it. ‘You shall relish him more in the scholar
than the soldier:’ but his monotony did not fatigue, his formality
did not displease; because there was always sense and meaning in
what he did. The fineness of Mr. Kemble’s figure may be supposed
to have led to that statue-like appearance, which his acting was sometimes
too apt to assume: as the diminutiveness of Mr. Kean’s person
has probably compelled him to bustle about too much, and to attempt
to make up for the want of dignity of form, by the violence and contrast
of his attitudes. If Mr. Kemble were to remain in the same
posture for half an hour, his figure would only excite admiration: if
Mr. Kean were to stand still only for a moment, the contrary effect
would be apparent. One of the happiest and most spirited of all
Mr. Kemble’s performances, and in which even his defects were
blended with his excellences to produce a perfect whole, was his
Pierre. The dissolute indifference assumed by this character, to
cover the darkness of his designs, and the fierceness of his revenge,
accorded admirably with Mr. Kemble’s natural manner; and the
tone of morbid rancorous raillery, in which Pierre delights to indulge,
was in unison with the actor’s reluctant, contemptuous personifications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>of gaiety, with the scornful spirit of his Comic Muse, which always
laboured—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">invita Minerva</span></i>—against the grain. Cato was another of
those parts for which Mr. Kemble was peculiarly fitted by his
physical advantages. There was nothing for him to do in this
character, but to appear in it. It had all the dignity of still-life. It
was a studied piece of classical costume—a conscious exhibition of
elegantly disposed drapery, that was all: yet, as a mere display
of personal and artificial grace, it was inimitable.</p>

<p class='c021'>It has been suggested that Mr. Kemble chiefly excelled in his
Roman characters, and among others in Brutus. If it be meant, that
he excelled in those which imply a certain stoicism of feeling and
energy of will, this we have already granted; but Brutus is not a
character of this kind, and Mr. Kemble failed in it for that reason.
Brutus is not a stoic, but a humane enthusiast. There is a tenderness
of nature under the garb of assumed severity; an inward current of
generous feelings, which burst out, in spite of circumstances, with
bleeding freshness; a secret struggle of mind, and disagreement
between his situation and his intentions; a lofty inflexibility of purpose,
mingled with an effeminate abstractedness of thought, which
Mr. Kemble did not give.</p>

<p class='c021'>In short, we think the distinguishing excellence of his acting may
be summed up in one word—<i>intensity</i>; in the seizing upon some one
feeling or idea, in insisting upon it, in never letting it go, and in
working it up, with a certain graceful consistency, and conscious
grandeur of conception, to a very high degree of pathos or sublimity.
If he had not the unexpected bursts of nature and genius, he had all
the regularity of art; if he did not display the tumult and conflict of
opposite passions in the soul, he gave the deepest and most permanent
interest to the uninterrupted progress of individual feeling; and in
embodying a high idea of certain characters, which belong rather to
sentiment than passion, to energy of will, than to loftiness or to
originality of imagination, he was the most excellent actor of his
time. This praise of him is not exaggerated: the blame we have
mixed with it is not invidious. We have only to add to both, the
expression of our grateful remembrances and best wishes—Hail, and
farewell!</p>

<div class='c031'>[<i>January, 1820.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>In commencing our account of the drama for the year 1820, and
turning our eye back, as far as our personal recollection reaches,
towards the conclusion of the last century, we do not think we
should be justified, by the customary topics of comparison, or
privileges of criticism, in making a general complaint of the
degeneracy of the stage. Within our remembrance, at least, it has
not fallen off to any alarming degree, either in the written or the
acted performances. It has changed its style considerably in both
these respects, but it does not follow that it has altogether deteriorated:
it has shifted its ground, but has found its level. With
respect to the pieces brought out, we have got striking melo-drames
for dull tragedies; and short farces are better than long ones of five
acts. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">semper varium et mutabile</span></i> of the poet, may be transferred
to the stage, ‘the inconstant stage,’ without losing the original felicity
of the application:—it has its necessary ebbs and flows, from its
subjection to the influence of popular feeling, and the frailty of the
materials of which it is composed, its own fleeting and shadowy
essence and cannot be expected to remain for any great length of
time stationary at the same point, either of perfection or debasement.
Acting, in particular, which is the chief organ by which it addresses
itself to the mind;—the eye, tongue, hand by which it dazzles,
charms, and seizes on the public attention—is an art that seems to
contain in itself the seeds of perpetual renovation and decay, following
in this respect the order of nature rather than the analogy of
the productions of human intellect,—for whereas in the other arts
of painting and poetry, the standard works of genius being permanent
and accumulating, for awhile provoke emulation, but, in the end,
overlay future efforts, and transmit only their defects to those that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>come after; the exertions of the greatest actor die with him, leaving
to his successors only the admiration of his name, and the aspiration
after imaginary excellence: so that in effect ‘no one generation of
actors binds another;’ the art is always setting out afresh on the
stock of genius and nature, and the success depends (generally
speaking) on accident, opportunity, and encouragement. The
harvest of excellence (whatever it may be) is removed from the
ground every twenty or thirty years, by Death’s sickle; and there
is room left for another to sprout up and tower to an equal height,
and spread into equal luxuriance—to ‘dally with the wind, and
court the sun’—according to the health and vigour of the stem,
and the favourableness of the season. But books, pictures, remain
like fixtures in the public mind; beyond a certain point incumber
the soil of living truth and nature; and distort or stunt the growth
of original genius. Again, the literary amateur may find employment
for his time in reading old authors only, and exhaust his entire spleen
in scouting new ones: but the lover of the stage cannot amuse himself,
in his solitary fastidiousness, by sitting to witness a play got
up by the departed ghosts of first-rate actors; or be contented with
the perusal of a collection of old play-bills:—he may extol Garrick,
but he must go to see Kean; and, in his own defence, must admire
or at least tolerate what he sees, or stay away against his will. The
theatrical critic may grumble a little, at first, at a new candidate for
the favour of the town, and say how much better the part must have
been done formerly by some actor whom he never saw; but by
degrees he makes a virtue of necessity, and submits to be pleased
‘with coy, reluctant, amorous delay’—devoting his attention to the
actual stage as he would to a living mistress, whom he selects as a
matter of course from the beauties of the present, and not from those
of the last age! We think there is for this reason less pedantry
and affectation (though not less party-feeling and personal prejudice)
in judging of the stage than of most other subjects; and we feel
a sort of theoretical, as well as instinctive predilection for the faces
of <i>play-going</i> people as among the most sociable, gossipping, good-natured,
and humane members of society. In this point of view,
as well as in others, the stage is a test and school of humanity. We
do not much like any person or persons who do not like plays; and
for this reason, viz. that we imagine they cannot much like themselves
or any one else. The really humane man (except in cases of
unaccountable prejudices, which we do not think the most likely
means to increase or preserve the natural amiableness of his disposition)
is prone to the study of humanity. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Omnes boni et liberales</i>
<span class='fss'>HUMANITATI</span> <i>semper favemus.</i></span> He likes to see it brought home from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>the universality of precepts and general terms, to the reality of persons,
of tones, and actions; and to have it raised from the grossness and
familiarity of sense, to the lofty but striking platform of the imagination.
He likes to see the face of man with the veil of time torn
from it, and to feel the pulse of nature beating in all times and
places alike. The smile of good-humoured surprise at folly, the
tear of pity at misfortune, do not misbecome the face of man or
woman. It is something delightful and instructive, to have seen
Coriolanus or King John in the habiliments of Mr. Kemble, to have
shaken hands almost with Othello in the person of Mr. Kean, to
have cowered before the spirit of Lady Macbeth in the glance of
Mrs. Siddons. The stage at once gives a body to our thoughts,
and refinement and expansion to our sensible impressions. It has
not the pride and remoteness of abstract science: it has not the
petty egotism of vulgar life. It is particularly wanted in great
cities (where it of course flourishes most) to take off from the
dissatisfaction and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, that creep over our own pursuits from the
indifference or contempt thrown upon them by others; and at the
same time to reconcile our numberless discordant incommensurable
feelings and interests together, by giving us an immediate and
common topic to engage our attention, and to rally us round the
standard of our common humanity. We never hate a face that we
have seen in the pit: and Liston’s laugh would be a cordial to
wash down the oldest animosity of the most inveterate pit-critics.</p>

<p class='c021'>The only drawback on the felicity and triumphant self-complacency
of a play-goer’s life, arises from the shortness of life itself. We
miss the favourites, not of another age, but of our own—the idols
of our youthful enthusiasm; and we cannot replace them by others.
It does not shew that <i>these</i> are worse, because they are different
from <i>those</i>: though they had been better, they would not have been
so good to us. It is the penalty of our nature, from Adam downwards:
so Milton makes our first ancestor exclaim,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Should God create</div>
      <div class='line'>Another Eve, and I another rib afford,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet loss of thee would never from my heart.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>We offer our best affections, our highest aspirations after the good
and beautiful, on the altar of youth: it is well if, in our after-age,
we can sometimes rekindle the almost extinguished flame, and inhale
its dying fragrance like the breath of incense, of sweet-smelling
flowers and gums, to detain the spirit of life, the ethereal guest, a
little longer in its frail abode—to cheer and soothe it with the
pleasures of memory, not with those of hope. While we can do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>this, life is worth living for: when we can do it no longer, its
spring will soon go down, and we had better not be!—Who shall
give us Mrs. Siddons again, but in a waking dream, a beatific vision
of past years, crowned with other hopes and other feelings, whose
pomp is also faded, and their glory and their power gone! Who
shall in our time (or can ever to the eye of fancy) fill the stage,
like her, with the dignity of their persons, and the emanations of
their minds? Or who shall sit majestic in the throne of tragedy—a
Goddess, a prophetess and a Muse—from which the lightning of
her eye flashed o’er the mind, startling its inmost thoughts—and
the thunder of her voice circled through the labouring breast,
rousing deep and scarce known feelings from their slumber? Who
shall stalk over the stage of horrors, its presiding genius, or ‘play
the hostess,’ at the banquetting scene of murder? Who shall walk in
sleepless ecstasy of soul, and haunt the mind’s eye ever after, with the
dread pageantry of suffering and of guilt? Who shall make tragedy
once more stand with its feet upon the earth, and with its head raised
above the skies, weeping tears and blood? That loss is not to be
repaired. While the stage lasts, there will never be another Mrs.
Siddons! Tragedy seemed to set with her; and the rest are but blazing
comets or fiery exhalations.—It is pride and happiness enough for us
to have lived at the same time with her, and one person more! But
enough on this subject. Those feelings that we are most anxious to
do justice to, are those to which it is impossible we ever should!</p>

<p class='c021'>To turn to something less serious. We have not the same pomp
of tragedy nor the same gentility, variety, and correctness in
comedy. There was the gay, fluttering, hair-brained Lewis; he
that was called ‘Gentleman Lewis,’—all life, and fashion, and
volubility, and whim; the greatest comic <i>mannerist</i> that perhaps
ever lived; whose head seemed to be in his heels, and his wit at
his fingers’ ends: who never let the stage stand still, and made your
heart light and your head giddy with his infinite vivacity, and bustle,
and hey-day animal spirits. We wonder how Death ever caught
him in his mad, whirling career, or ever fixed his volatile spirit in
a dull <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">caput mortuum</span></i> of dust and ashes? Nobody could break open
a door, or jump over a table, or scale a ladder, or twirl a cocked
hat, or dangle a cane, or play a jockey-nobleman, or a nobleman’s
jockey, like him. He was at Covent Garden. With him was
Quick, who made an excellent self-important, busy, strutting, money-getting
citizen; or crusty old guardian, in a brown suit and a bob
wig. There was also Munden, who was as good an actor then,
as he is now; and Fawcett, who was at that time a much better
one than he is at present. He, of late, seems to slur over his parts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>wishes to merge the actor in the manager, and is grown serious
before retiring from the stage. But a few years back (when he ran
the race of popularity with Jack Bannister) nobody could give the
<i>view holla</i> of a fox-hunting country squire like him; and he sung
<span class='fss'>AMO AMAS</span>, as Lingo in the Agreeable Surprise, in a style of pathos
to melt the heart of the young apprentices in the two shilling gallery.
But he appears to have grown averse to his profession, and indifferent
to the applause he might acquire himself, and to the pleasures he
used to give to others. In turbulent and pragmatical characters,
and in all that cast of parts which may be called the <i>slang</i> language
of comedy, he hardly had his equal. Perhaps he might consider
this walk of his art as beneath his ambition; but, in our judgment,
whatever a man can do best, is worth his doing. At the same
house was little Simmons, who remained there till lately, like a
veteran at his post, till he fell down a flight of steps and broke his
neck, without any one’s seeming to know or care about the matter.
Though one of those ‘who had gladdened life,’ his death by no
means ‘eclipsed the gaiety of nations.’ The public are not grateful.
They make an effort of generosity, collect all their reluctant admiration
into a heap, and offer it up with servile ostentation at the shrine
of some great name, which they think reflects back its lustre on the
worshippers. Or, like fashionable creditors, they pay their debts
of honour for the <i>eclat</i> of the thing, and neglect the claims of
humbler but sterling merit; such as was that of Simmons, one of
the most correct, pointed, <i>naive</i>, and whimsical comic actors, we
have for a long time had, or are likely to have again. He was not
a buffoon, but a real actor. He did not play <i>himself</i>, nor play tricks,
but played the part the author had assigned him. This was the
great merit of the good old style of acting. He fitted into it like
a brilliant into the setting of a ring, or as the ring fits the finger.
We shall look for him often in Filch, in which his appearance was
a continual <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i>, with one eye leering at his neighbour’s
pockets, and the other turned to the gallows:—also in the spangled
Beau Mordecai, in Moses, in which he had all the precision, the
pragmaticalness, and impenetrable secresy of the Jew money-lender;
and in my Lord Sands, where he had all the stage to himself,
and seemed to fill it by the singular insignificance of his person, and
the infinite airs he gave himself. We shall look for him in these
and many other parts, but in vain, or for any one equal to him.</p>

<p class='c021'>At the other house, there was King, whose acting left a taste on
the palate, sharp and sweet like a quince; with an old, hard, rough,
withered face, like a John-apple, puckered up into a thousand
wrinkles; with shrewd hints and tart replies; ‘with nods and becks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>and wreathed smiles;’ who was the real amorous, wheedling, or
hasty, choleric, peremptory old gentleman in Sir Peter Teazle and
Sir Anthony Absolute; and the true, that is, the pretended, clown
in Touchstone, with wit sprouting from his head like a pair of ass’s
ears, and folly perched on his cap like the horned owl. There was
Parsons too, whom we just remember like a worn-out ‘suit of
office’ in Elbow; and Dodd in Acres, who had the most extraordinary
way of hitching in a meaning, or subsiding into blank folly
with the best grace in nature; and whose courage seemed literally
to ooze out of his fingers in the preparations for the duel. There
was Suett, the delightful old croaker, the everlasting Dicky Gossip
of the stage; and, with him, Jack Bannister, whose gaiety, good
humour, cordial feeling, and natural spirits, shone through his
characters, and lighted them up like a transparency. Bannister
did not go out of himself to take possession of his part, but put it
on over his ordinary dress, like a <i>surtout</i>, snug, warm, and comfortable.
He let his personal character appear through; and it
was one great charm of his acting. In Lenitive, in the Prize,
when the beau is ingrafted on the apothecary, he came out of his
shell like the aurelia out of the grub; and surely never lighted on
the stage, which he hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision—gilding,
and cheering the motley sphere he just began to move in—shining
like a gilded pill, fluttering like a piece of gold-leaf, gaudy as
a butterfly, loud as a grasshopper, full of life, and laughter, and joy.
His Scrub, in which he spouts a torrent of home-brewed ale against
the ceiling, in a sudden fit of laughter at the waggeries of his brother
Martin;—his Son-in-law; his part in the Grandmother; his
Autolycus; his Colonel Feignwell; and his Walter in the Children
in the Wood, were all admirable. Most of his characters were
exactly fitted for him—for his good-humoured smile, his buoyant
activity, his kind heart, and his honest face: and no one else could
do them so well, because no one else could play Jack Bannister. He
was, some time since, seen casting a wistful eye at Drury-lane theatre,
and no doubt thinking of past times: others who also cast a wistful
eye at it, do not forget him when they think of old and happy times!
There were Bob and Jack Palmer, the Brass and Dick of the
Confederacy; the one the pattern of an elder, the other of a younger
brother. There was Wewitzer, the trustiest of Swiss valets, and
the most ‘secret Tattle’ of the stage. There was, and there still
is, Irish Johnstone, with his supple knees, his hat twisted round in
his hand, his good-humoured laugh, his arched eye-brows, his
insinuating leer, and his lubricated <i>brogue</i>, curling round the ear like
a well oiled mustachio. These were all the men. Then there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>Miss Farren, with her fine-lady airs and graces, with that elegant
turn of her head, and motion of her fan, and tripping of her tongue;
and Miss Pope, the very picture of a Duenna, a maiden lady, or an
antiquated dowager—the latter spring of beauty, the second childhood
of vanity, more quaint, fantastic, and old-fashioned, more pert, frothy,
and light-headed than any thing that can be imagined; embalmed
in the follies, preserved in the spirit of affectation of the last age:—and
then add to these, Mrs. Jordan, the child of nature, whose
voice was a cordial to the heart, because it came from it, rich, full,
like the luscious juice of the ripe grape; to hear whose laugh was
to drink nectar; whose smile ‘made a sunshine,’ not ‘in the shady
place,’ but amidst dazzling lights and in glad theatres:—who ‘talked
far above singing,’ and whose singing was like the twang of Cupid’s
bow. Her person was large, soft, and generous like her soul. It
has been attempted to compare Miss Kelly to her. There is no
comparison. Miss Kelly is a shrewd, clever, arch, lively girl;
tingles all over with suppressed sensibility; licks her lips at mischief,
bites her words in two, or lets a sly meaning out of the corners of
her eyes; is fidgetty with curiosity, or unable to stand still for
spite:—she is always uneasy and always interesting; but Mrs.
Jordan was all exuberance and grace, ‘her bounty was as boundless
as the sea; her love as deep.’ It was her capacity for enjoyment,
and the contrast she presented to every thing sharp, angular, and
peevish, that communicated the same genial heartfelt satisfaction to
the spectator. Her Nell, for instance, was right royal like her
liquor, and wrapped up in measureless content with lambs’ wool.
Miss Kelly is a dextrous knowing chambermaid: Mrs. Jordan had
nothing dexterous or knowing about her. She was Cleopatra turned
into an oyster-wench, without knowing that she was Cleopatra, or
caring that she was an oyster-wench. An oyster-wench, such as
she was, would have been equal to a Cleopatra; and an Antony
would not have deserted her for the empire of the world!</p>

<p class='c021'>From the favourite actors of a few years back, we turn to those of
the present day: and we shall speak of them, not with grudging or
stinted praise.</p>

<p class='c021'>The first of these in tragedy is Mr. Kean. To show that we do
not conceive that tragedy regularly declines in every successive
generation, we shall say, that we do not think there has been in
our remembrance any tragic performer (with the exception of Mrs.
Siddons) equal to Mr. Kean. Nor, except in voice and person,
and the conscious ease and dignity naturally resulting from those
advantages, do we know that even Mrs. Siddons was greater. In
truth of nature and force of passion, in discrimination and originality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>we see no inferiority to any one on the part of Mr. Kean: but
there is an insignificance of figure, and a hoarseness of voice, that
necessarily <i>vulgarize</i>, or diminish our idea of the characters he plays:
and perhaps to this may be added, a want of a certain correspondent
elevation and magnitude of thought, of which Mrs. Siddons’s noble
form seemed to be only the natural mould and receptacle. Her
nature seemed always above the circumstances with which she had
to struggle: her soul to be greater than the passion labouring in
her breast. Grandeur was the cradle in which her genius was
rocked: for <i>her</i> to be, was to be sublime! She did the greatest
things with child-like ease: her powers seemed never tasked to the
utmost, and always as if she had inexhaustible resources still in
reserve. The least word she uttered seemed to float to the end of
the stage: the least motion of her hand seemed to command awe
and obedience. Mr. Kean is all effort, all violence, all extreme
passion: he is possessed with a fury, a demon that leaves him no
repose, no time for thought, or room for imagination. He perhaps
screws himself up to as intense a degree of feeling as Mrs. Siddons,
strikes home with as sure and as hard a blow as she did, but he
does this by straining every nerve, and winding up every faculty to
this single point alone: and as he does it by an effort himself, the
spectator follows him by an effort also. Our sympathy in a manner
ceases with the actual impression, and does not leave the same grand
and permanent image of itself behind. The Othello furnishes
almost the only exception to these remarks. The solemn and
beautiful manner in which he pronounces the farewell soliloquy, is
worth all gladiatorship and pantomime in the world. His Sir Giles
is his most equal and energetic character: but it is too equal, too
energetic from the beginning to the end. There is no reason that
he should have the same eagerness, the same <i>impetus</i> at the commencement
as at the close of his career: he should not have the fierceness
of the wild beast till he is goaded to madness by the hunters. Sir
Giles Mompesson (supposed to be the original character) we dare
say, took things more quietly, and only grew desperate with his
fortunes. Cooke played the general casting of the character better
in this respect: but without the same fine breaks and turns of passion.
Cooke indeed, compared to Kean, had only the <i>slang</i> and <i>bravado</i>
of tragedy. Neither can we think Mr. Kemble equal to him, with
all his study, his grace, and classic dignity of form. He was the
statue of perfect tragedy, not the living soul. Mrs. Siddons combined
the advantage of form and other organic requisites with nature
and passion: Mr. Kemble has the external requisites, (at least of
face and figure) without the internal workings of the soul: Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Kean has the last without the first, and, if we must make our election
between the two, we think the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis tragica</span></i> must take precedence of
every thing else. Mr. Kean, in a word, appears to us a test, an
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum crucis</span></i>, to shew the triumph of genius over physical
defects, of nature over art, of passion over affectation, and of
originality over common-place monotony.—Next to Mr. Kean, the
greatest tragic performer now on the stage is undoubtedly Miss
O’Neill. She cannot take rank by the side of her great predecessor,
but neither can any other actress be at all compared with her. If
we had not seen Mrs. Siddons, we should not certainly have been
able to conceive any thing finer than some of her characters, such
as Belvidera, Isabella in the Fatal Marriage, Mrs. Beverly, and
Mrs. Haller, which (as she at first played them) in tenderness of
sensibility, and the simple force of passion, could not be surpassed.
She has, however, of late, carried the expression of mental agony
and distress to a degree of physical horror that is painful to behold,
and which is particularly repulsive in a person of her delicacy of
frame and truly feminine appearance.—Mrs. Bunn is a beautiful and
interesting actress in the sentimental drama; and in the part of
Queen Elizabeth, in Schiller’s Tragedy of Mary Stuart, which she
played lately, gave, in the agitation of her form, the distracted
thoughts painted in her looks, and the deep but fine and mellow
tones of her voice, earnest of higher excellence than she has yet
displayed. Her voice is one of the finest on the stage. It resembles
the deep murmur of a hive of bees in spring-tide, and the words drop
like honey from her lips.—Mr. Macready is, in our opinion, a
truly spirited and impassioned declaimer, with a noble voice, and
great fervour of manner; but, we apprehend, his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> is rather in
giving a loose to the tide of enthusiastic feeling or sentiment, than
in embodying individual character, or discriminating the diversity of
the passions. There is a gaiety and tip-toe elevation in his personal
deportment, which Mr. Kean has not, but in other more essential
points there is no room for competition. Of his Coriolanus and
Richard, we may have to speak in detail hereafter.</p>

<p class='c021'>We shall conclude this introductory sketch with a few words on
the comic actors. Emery at Covent Garden might be said to be
the best <i>provincial</i> actor on the London boards. In his line of
rustic characters he is a perfect actor. He would be a bold critic
who should undertake to show that in his own walk Emery ever
did any thing wrong. His Hodge is an absolute reality; and his
Lockitt is as sullen, as gloomy, and impenetrable as the prison walls
of which he is the keeper. His Robert Tyke is the sublime of
tragedy in low life.—Mr. Liston has more comic humour, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>power of face, and a more genial and happy vein of folly, than any
other actor we remember. His farce is not caricature: his drollery
oozes out of his features, and trickles down his face: his voice is
a pitch-pipe for laughter. He does some characters but indifferently,
others respectably; but when he <i>puts himself whole</i> into a jest, it is
unrivalled.—Munden with all his merit, his whim, his imagination,
and with his broad effects, is a caricaturist in the comparison. He
distorts his features to the utmost stretch of grimace, and trolls his
voice about with his tongue in the most extraordinary manner, but
he does all this with an evident view to the audience: whereas
Liston’s style of acting is the unconscious and involuntary; he
indulges his own risibility or absurd humours to please himself, and
the odd noises he makes come from him as naturally as the bleating
of a sheep.—Elliston is an actor of great merit, and of a very
agreeable class: there is a joyousness in his look, his voice, and
manner; he treads the stage as if it was his ‘best-found, and latest
as well as earliest choice;’ writes himself comedian in any book,
warrant, or acquittance; hits the town between wind and water,
between farce and tragedy; touches the string of a mock heroic
sentiment with due pathos and vivacity; and makes the best strolling
gentleman, or needy poet, on the stage. His Rover is excellent:
so is his Duke in the Honeymoon; and in Matrimony he is best of
all.—Dowton is a genuine and excellent comedian; and, in speaking
of his Major Sturgeon, we cannot pass over, in disdainful silence,
Russell’s Jerry Sneak, and Mrs. Harlowe’s Miss Molly Jollop.
Oxberry is an actor of a strong rather than of a pleasant comic vein
(his Mawworm is particularly emphatical). Harley pleases others,
for he seems pleased himself; and little Knight, in the simplicity
and good nature of the country lad, is inimitable.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of the particular parts in which these and other performers display
their talents to advantage, we must speak in future articles on this
subject; as well as of the merits of the modern drama itself; the
management of our theatres; and a variety of other topics, to which
we propose to give the best attention in our power—determined
neither to ‘extenuate, nor set down aught in malice.’</p>

<div class='c031'>[<i>February, 1820.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>Since we wrote a former article on this subject, the stage has lost
one of its principal ornaments and fairest supports, in the person of
Miss O’Neill. As Miss Somerville changed her name for that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Mrs. Bunn, and still remains on the stage, so Miss O’Neill has altered
hers for Mrs. Beecher, and has, we fear, quitted us for good and all.
‘There were two upon the house-top: one was taken, and the other
was left!’ Though, on our own accounts, we do not think this ‘a
consummation devoutly to be wished,’ yet we cannot say we are sorry
on her’s. Hymen has, in this instance, with his flaming torch and
saffron robe, borne a favourite actress from us, and held her fast,
beyond the seas and sounding shores, ‘to our moist vows denied’:
but, whatever complaints or repinings have been heard on the
occasion, we think Miss O’Neill was in the right to do as she
has done. <i>Fast bind fast find</i>, is an old proverb, and a good one,
and is no doubt applicable to both sexes, and on both sides of the
water. A husband, like death, cancels all other claims, and we
think, more especially, any imaginary and imperfect obligations, (with
a clipt sixpence, and clap hands and a bargain) to the stage or to the
town. Miss O’Neill, (for so her name may yet linger on our tongues)
made good her retreat in time from the world’s ‘slippery turns,’ and
we are glad that she has done so. It is better to retire from the
stage, when young, with fame and fortune, than to have to return to
it when old (as Mrs. Crawfurd, Mrs. Abington, and so many others
have done) in poverty, neglect, and scorn. There is no marriage for
better and for worse to the public; it is but a ‘Mr. Limberham, or
Kind Keeper,’ at the very best: it does not tie itself to worship its
favourites, or ‘with its worldly goods them endow,’ through good
report, or evil report, in sickness or in health, ‘till death them do
part.’ No such thing is even thought of: they must be always
young, always beautiful, and dazzling, and allowed to be so; or they
are instantly discarded, and they pass from their full-blown pride, and
the purple light that irradiates them, into ‘the list of weeds, and wornout
faces.’ If a servant of the theatre dismisses himself without due
warning, it makes a great deal of idle talk: but, on the other hand,
does the theatre never dismiss one of its servants without formal
notice, and is any thing then said about it? How many old
favourites of the town—that many-headed abstraction, with new
opinions, whims, and follies ever sprouting from its teeming brain;
how many decayed veterans of the stage, do we remember, in the last
ten or twenty years, laid aside ‘in monumental mockery’; thrown
from the pinnacle of prosperity and popularity, to pine in poverty and
obscurity, their names forgotten, or staring in large capitals, asking for
a benefit at some minor theatre! How many of these are to be seen,
walking about with shrunk shanks and tattered hose, avoiding the eye
of the stranger whom they suppose to have known them in better
days; straggling through the streets with faultering steps, and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>some hopeless errand,—with sinking hearts, or heart-broken long
ago:—engaged, dismissed again, tampered with, tantalised, trifled
with, pelted, hooted, scorned, unpitied: performing quarantine at a
distance from the centre of all their hopes and wishes, as if their
names were a stain on their former reputations;—or perhaps received
once more,—tolerated, endured out of charity, in the very places that
they once adorned and gladdened by their presence!—And all this,
often without any fault in themselves, any misconduct, any change,
but in the taste and humour of the audience; or from their own
imprudence, in not guarding (while they had the opportunity) against
the ingratitude and treachery of that very public, that claims them as
its property, and would make them its slaves and puppets for life—or
during pleasure! We might make out a long list of superannuated
pensioners on public patronage, who have had the last grudging
pittance of favour withdrawn from them, but that it could do no sort
of good, and that we would not expose the names themselves to the
gaze and wonder of vulgar curiosity. We are only not sorry that
Miss O’Neill has put it out of the power of the Nobility, the Gentry,
and her Friends in general, to add her name to the splendid, tarnished
list; and that she cannot, like so many of her predecessors, be
chopped and changed, and hacked, and banded about, in tragedy, or
in comedy, in farce or in pantomime, in dance or song, at the Surry,
or the Cobourg, or the Sans Pareil Theatres; or even be sent to
mingle her silvery cadences with Mr. Kean’s hoarse notes at Old
Drury!</p>

<p class='c021'>Before, however, we take leave of her for ever in that capacity in
which she has so often delighted, and so often astonished us, we must
be excused in saying a few parting words of that excellence, which,
for the future, can be known (how very imperfectly!) only by
description, and be remembered only as an enchanting dream. We
believe that ladies, even after the marriage ceremony, sign their
maiden names in the church-register: we hope that Miss O’Neill
will not refuse to subscribe, in the same manner, to our critical
jurisdiction, for the last time that we shall have to exercise it
upon her.</p>

<p class='c021'>Miss O’Neill was in size of the middle form: her complexion was
fair: and her person not inelegant. She stooped somewhat in the
shoulders, but not so as to destroy grace or dignity:—in moving
across the stage, she dragged a little in her step, with some want of
firmness and elasticity. The action of her hands and arms, however
(one of the least common, and therefore, we suppose, one of the
most difficult accomplishments an actor or actress has to acquire)
was perfectly just, simple and expressive. They either remained in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>unconscious repose by her side, or, if employed, it was to anticipate
or confirm the language of the eye and tongue. There was no
affectation, no unmeaning display, or awkward deficiency in her
gesticulation; but her body and mind seemed to be under the
guidance of the same impulse, to move in concert, and to be moulded
into unity of effect by a certain natural grace, earnestness, and good
sense. The contour of her face was nearly oval; and her features
approached to the regularity of the Grecian outline. The expression
of them was confined either to the extremity of pain and agony, or to
habitual softness and placidity, with an occasional smile of great
sweetness. Her voice was deep, clear, and mellow, capable of the
most forcible exertion, but, in ordinary speaking, ‘gentle and low,
an excellent thing in woman!’ She, however, owed comparatively
little to physical qualifications: there was nothing in her face, voice,
or person, sufficiently striking to have obtruded her into notice, or to
have been a factitious substitute for other requisites. Her external
advantages were merely the medium through which her internal
powers displayed their refulgence, without obstruction or refraction
(with the exception hereafter to be stated): they were the passive
instruments, which her powerful and delicate sensibility wielded, with
the utmost propriety, ease, and effect. Her excellence (unrivalled
by any actress since Mrs. Siddons) consisted in truth of nature, and
force of passion. Her correctness did not seem the effect of art or
study, but of instinctive sympathy, of a conformity of mind and disposition
to the character she was playing, as if she had unconsciously
become the very person. There were no catching lights, no pointed
hits, no theatrical tricks, no female arts resorted to, in her best or
general style of acting: there was a singleness, an entireness, and
harmony in it, that gave it a double charm as well as a double power.
It rested on the centre of its own feelings. Her style of acting was
smooth, round, polished, and classical, like a marble statue; self-supported,
and self-involved; owing its resemblance to life, to the
truth of imitation; not to startling movements, and restless contortion,
but returning continually within the softened line of beauty and nature.
Her manner was, in this respect, the opposite of Mr. Kean’s, of
whom no man can say (either in a good or in a bad sense) that he is
like a marble statue, but of whom it may be said, with some appearance
of truth, that he is like a paste-board figure, the little, uncouth,
disproportioned parts of which, children pull awry, twitch, and jerk
about in fifty odd and unaccountable directions, to laugh at—or like
the mock figure of Harlequin, that is stuck against the wall, and
pulled in pieces, and fastened together again, with twenty idle,
pantomimic, eccentric absurdities! Or he seems to have St. Antony’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>fire in his veins, St. Vitus’s dance in his limbs, and a devil tugging at
every part:—one shrugging his shoulders, another wagging his head,
another hobbling in his legs, another tapping his breast; one straining
his voice till it is ready to crack, another suddenly, and surprisingly,
dropping it down into an inaudible whisper, which is made distinct
and clear by the ‘<i>bravos</i>’ in the pit, and the shouts of the gallery.
There was not any of this paltry patch-work, these vulgar snatches at
applause, these stops, and starts, and breaks, in Miss O’Neill’s performance,
which was sober, sedate, and free from pretence and
mummery. We regret her loss the more, and fear we shall have to
regret it more deeply every day. In a word, Mr. Kean’s acting is
like an anarchy of the passions, in which each upstart humour, or
phrensy of the moment, is struggling to get violent possession of some
bit or corner of his fiery soul and pigmy body—to jostle out, and lord
it over, the rest of the rabble of short-lived, and furious purposes.
Miss O’Neill seemed perfect mistress of her own thoughts, and if she
was not indeed the rightful queen of tragedy, she had at least all the
decorum, grace, and self-possession of one of the Maids of Honour
waiting around its throne.—Miss O’Neill might have played, to the
greatest advantage, in one of the tragedies of Sophocles, which are
the perfection of the stately, elegant, and simple drama of the Greeks;
we cannot conceive of Mr. Kean making a part of any such classical
group. Perhaps, however, we may magnify his defects in this
particular, as we have been accused of over-rating his general merits.
We do not think it an easy matter ‘to praise him, or blame him too
much.’ We have never heard any thing to alter the opinion we
always entertained of him: he can only do it himself—by his own
acting. While we owe it to him to speak largely of his genius
and his powers, we owe it to the public to protest against the
eccentricities of the one, or the abuses of the other.</p>

<p class='c021'>To return from this digression. With all the purity and simplicity,
Miss O’Neill possessed the utmost force of tragedy. Her soul was
like the sea, calm, beautiful, smiling, smooth, and yielding; but the
storm of adversity lashed it into foam, laid bare its centre, or heaved
its billows against the skies. She could repose on gentleness, or
dissolve in tenderness, and at the same time give herself up to all the
agonies of woe. She could express fond affection, pity, rage, despair,
madness. She felt all these passions in their simple and undefinable
elements only. She felt them as a woman,—as a mistress, as a wife,
a mother, or a friend. She seemed to have the most exquisite sense
of the pressure of those soft ties, that were woven round her heart,
and that bound her to her place in society; and the rending them
asunder appeared to give a proportionable revulsion to her frame, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>disorder to her thoughts. There was nothing in her acting of a preternatural
or <i>ideal</i> cast—that could lift the mind above mortality, or
might be fancied to descend from another sphere. But she gave the
full, the true, and unalloyed expression, to all that is common, obvious,
and heart-felt in the charities of private life, and in the conflict of
female virtue and attachment with the hardest trials and intolerable
griefs. She did not work herself up to the extremity of passion, by
questioning with her own thoughts; or raise herself above circumstances,
by ascending the platform of imagination; or arm herself
against fate, by strengthening her will to meet it: no, she yielded to
calamity, she gave herself up entire, and with entire devotion, to her
unconquerable despair:—it was the tide of anguish swelling in her
own breast, that overflowed to the breasts of the audience, and filled
their eyes with tears as the loud torrent projects itself from the cliff
to the abyss below, and bears everything before it in its resistless
course. The source of her command over public sympathy, lay, in
short, in the intense conception, and unrestrained expression, of what
she, and every other woman, of natural sensibility would feel in given
circumstances, in which she, and every other woman, was liable to
be placed. Her Belvidera, Isabella, Mrs. Beverley, etc. were all
characters of this strictly feminine class of heroines, and she played
them to the life. They were made of softness and suffering. We
recollect the first time we saw her in Belvidera, when the manner in
which she threw herself into the arms of Jaffier, before they part, was
as if her heart would have leaped out of her bosom, if she had not
done so. It staggered the spectator like a blow. Again, her first
meeting with Biron, in Isabella, was no less admirable and impressive.
She looked at, she saw, she knew him: her surprise, her joy were
painted in her face, and woke every nerve to rapture. She seemed
to have perfected all that her art could do. But the sudden alteration
of her look and manner, the shuddering and recoil within herself,
when she recovers from her surprise, and recollects her situation,
married to another,—at once on the verge of ecstacy and perdition,—baffled
description, and threw all that she had before done in the
shade,—‘like to another morn, risen on mid noon.’ We could
mention many other instances, but they are still too fresh in the
memory of our readers to make it necessary. It must be confessed,
as perhaps the only drawback on Miss O’Neill’s merit, or on the
pleasure derived from seeing her, that she sometimes carried the
expression of grief, or agony of mind, to a degree of physical horror
that could hardly be borne. Her shrieks, in the concluding scenes
of some of her parts, were like those of mandrakes, and you stopped
your ears against them: her looks were of ‘moody madness, laughing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>wild, amidst severest woe,’ and you turned your eyes from them;
for they seemed to sear like the lightening. Her eye-balls rolled in
her head: her words rattled in her throat. This was carrying reality
too far. The sufferings of the body are no longer proper for
dramatic exhibition when they become objects of painful attention in
themselves, and are not merely indications of what passes in the mind—comments
and interpreters of the moral sense within. The effect
was the more ungrateful from the very contrast (as we before hinted)
between this lady’s form and delicate complexion, and the violent
conflict into which she was thrown. She seemed like the little
flower, not the knotted oak, contending with the pitiless storm.
There appeared no reason why she should ‘mar that whiter skin of
her’s than snow, or monumental alabaster,’ or rend and dishevel, with
ruthless hand, those graceful locks, fairer than the opening day. But
these were faults arising from pushing truth and nature to an excess,
and we should, at present, be glad to see ‘the best virtues’ of others
make even an approach to them. Her common style of speaking had
a certain mild and equable intonation, not quite free from <i>manner</i>, but
in the more impassioned parts, she became proportionably natural,
bold, and varied. In comedy, Miss O’Neill did not, in our judgment,
excel: her <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> was the serious. Had we never seen her play
anything but Lady Teazle, we should not have felt the regret at
parting with her, which we now do, in common with every lover of
genius, and of the genuine drama.</p>

<p class='c021'>But it is high time that we should turn from the actors we have
lost, to those that still remain amongst us.—Among the novelties of
the season are, of course, the two Pantomimes, which, lest we should
forget them at last, we shall mention in the first place. We cannot
say that we exactly relish the taking Don Quixote as the subject of
a Pantomime. The knight was battered and bruised enough in his
life-time, without undergoing a gratuitous penance at this time of day.
With all our good-will to Mr. Grimaldi, we have a greater affection
for Sancho Panza, and do not want to see him metamorphosed into
anything but himself. Indeed we cannot spoil Don Quixote; but
neither need we try to do it.—Jack and the Bean Stalk is the
legitimate growth of the Christmas holidays, and the winter Theatres.
The wonders of the necromancer are equalled by the surprising arts
of the mechanist. The favoured Bean Stalk grows and ascends the
skies, as it did to our infant imaginations, and as if it would never
have done growing; and Ogres and Ogresses become familiar to our
senses, as to our early fears, in the enchanted palace of Drury-lane
Theatre. Seeing is sometimes believing. It is worth going to a
good Pantomime, if it was for no other reason than to hear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>children from school laugh at it, till they are ready to split their
sides. What we can no longer enjoy, or wonder at ourselves, it is
well to take at the rebound, in the reflection of happy faces, and in
the echo of joyous mirth. These little real folks are even better than
the fantastical beings, and poetic visions, we see upon the stage!</p>

<p class='c021'>We are sorry we cannot say anything to reverse the judgment
passed upon a new comedy, called <cite>Gallantry</cite>, or <cite>Adventures at Madrid</cite>,
brought out at this Theatre in the beginning of the month. It was <i>a
comedy of intrigue</i>; and, in conformity with the idea of this style of
invention, was decorated with a wearisome display of Spanish costume,
and enriched with an unmeaning catalogue of enamoured Dons, and
disdainful or neglected Donnas. The plot was intricate, so as to
become unintelligible, mechanical, and improbable. Every contrivance
‘had its brother, and half the story just reflects the other.’ There
was a strange and insurmountable coincidence of antithetical blunders
and epigrammatic accidents. The author’s invention seemed to <i>run
on all fours</i>, to cut out the different compartments of his fable, like
the figures in a country-dance, to answer to one another: or he made
all his characters turn the tables on one another, without knowing it.
Thus, if a lady sends a letter very innocently to the lover of another,
her own lover writes a letter to the mistress of his imaginary rival;
if an old fellow falls in love with a young lady, this turns out to be
his son’s intended bride; and in this manner the game of cross-purposes
is easily kept up, and the plot is diversified by the rule of
contraries throughout. There was little attempt at wit in this piece
(what little there is was flat and shallow, as well as gross), and there
was no attempt at interest or sentiment, except in the character of
Constantia, which was well played by Mrs. West, but very ill supported
by the author. Mr. Barnard was her lover; and we must say
that this gentleman spoils any intrigue in which he is engaged, if it
soars above a chambermaid. He plays an impudent, self-sufficient
valet, with good emphasis and discretion, or can get through an
under-steward very well; but he cannot act the hero or look the
gentleman. There is a cast of parts, for which Mr. Barnard is
really qualified; and we are unwilling to see him taken out of them,
both for his sake and our own. The play was altogether ill got up:
it indeed called out the strength of the house, but there was either
nothing for them to do, or their parts became them as little as their
dresses. Mr. Harley, for instance, who is always so lively in
himself, and who so often enlivens others, was put to play a villainous
grave Spanish Don, who is full of stratagem and deliberate knavery;
and he popped, and wriggled, and fidgetted on and off the stage,
nodding his airy plumes, and shaking the powdered locks, in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>he had been bedizened out, like the figure of Pug we have seen at
Bartlemy-Fair, or in Hogarth’s picture of the same little chuckling
favourite, in Fashion in High Life. The fault was not in Mr.
Harley, who always does his best to please, but in the cut of his
clothes, and the cast of his part. Russel had no business in the
play. He looked like an Alguazil, not like a Madrid gallant.
Instead of meddling with the Spanish cavalier, and strutting about
with a feather in his hat and a sword by his side, he should be
<i>At Home</i> every night of his life, in Jerry Sneak: he is abroad in
almost every other character! Munden made nothing of an
amorous, superannuated, wheedling old lord: and, making nothing
of the part ‘as it was set down for him,’ he tried, now and then,
to thrust in a little caricature of his own, and to insinuate a bye-joke
to the galleries. Munden’s is not ‘the courtier’s or the lover’s
melancholy;’ but a quaint, fantastical, uncouth, irresistible humour
of his own, and he must be strangely grouped, or disposed of, on
the theatrical canvass, to lose all his effect. Munden is not a sickly,
vapid, decayed inamorato, fit to make his approaches to his mistress’s
eyebrows, in good set terms, or with cringing manners: he is a sturdy
grotesque—a wild exotic, not a faded passion flower. He does not
belong to any class, fashionable or vulgar. He is himself alone:
and should only personate those extraordinary and marked characters,
that Gilray painted, and O’Keeffe drew. Dowton and Knight
were pieces of supererogation in the comedy of Gallantry; and
Mrs. Harlowe is only happy in those parts which are meant to be
unequivocally repulsive. Miss Kelly was neatly tucked up, in a
Spanish bodice and petticoat; and had to carry several messages
on or off the stage, in which she succeeded. The play languished
on to the end of the fifth act, and then died a natural death. The
only chance which it had of escaping was from one or two dramatic
situations, borrowed from well-known plays, but disfigured and
deprived of their effect, that they might pass for new. One of
these was, where Mrs. West, as Constantia, retires from her antiquated
lover (Munden) on his knees, in the middle of a speech, profuse of
sentiments and compliments, and leaves her maid, Mrs. Harlowe, to
receive the reversion of his protestations: the old gallant not discovering
his mistake, till he is interrupted by the entrance of company.
Mrs. Edwin delivered an Epilogue with some spirit, but its appeals
to the favour of the audience only bespoke repeated condemnation.
After the curtain dropped, Mr. Elliston, who had performed a part
in the piece, came forward to announce that it was withdrawn; but,
in submitting to the pleasure of the House, he seemed disposed to
dispute the soundness of their taste. He said, ‘It was a difficult
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>thing to write a good comedy; perhaps a more difficult thing to
judge of one.’ Critics as we are, we cannot make up our minds to
that opinion. Or we might say in answer, ‘It is an easy thing
to write a bad comedy; a more easy thing to judge of one.’<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c015'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Be
that as it may (for we do not wish to be drawn into a literary or
metaphysical controversy with the present manager of Drury Lane,)
we do not see what it was to the purpose. Does Mr. Elliston mean
to infer, that, because it is a difficult thing to judge of a good comedy,
he is a better judge than anyone else, or than the great majority of
the audience, who had pronounced sentence upon this? Suppose the
comedy had succeeded, as completely as it failed, and that a single
individual in the pit had got up to say, that he differed from everyone
present, and that his uncalled-for opinion was to be put in competition
with the voice of the House, would not Mr. Elliston have thought it
a great piece of impertinence and presumption? Why then should he
commit the same folly himself?</p>

<p class='c021'>At Covent Garden there have been two new debutants, Mr. Nathan
as Henry Bertram, in Guy Mannering, and Miss Wensley as Rosalind.
The first was a decided failure. We do not know what Mr. Nathan’s
powers of voice or execution in a room may be: but he has evidently
not the capacity of sending out a sufficient volume of articulate sound
to fill a large theatre: neither is his manner of speaking, nor his
action, at all fitted for the stage. Miss Wensley’s Rosalind was
well received, and has been repeated. Her face and figure are
agreeable; her voice has considerable sweetness and flexibility; and
her manner of performing the part itself, was arch, graceful, and
lively; though this young lady (who we understand had not appeared
before on any stage) was withheld from giving herself up entirely to
the character, by a natural and amiable timidity. We heartily wish
she may succeed, and have no fear but she will.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c015'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Miss Tree has lately
made a valuable addition to the musical strength of Covent Garden.
She sings delightfully in company with Miss Stephens; and in the
Comedy of Errors almost puzzles the town, as she does Antipholis
of Syracuse, which to prefer: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magis pares quam similes</span></i>. She is
quite different, both in quality of voice and style of execution, from
our old favourite; and it is this difference that completes the charm
of their singing. Her tones are as firm, deep, and mellow, as
Miss Stephens’s are clear and sweet. Her ear is as true as it is
possible to be; and the sustained manner in which she dwells upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>a note, is as delightful as the airy fluttering grace with which
Miss Stephens varies, and sportively plays with it. The singing
of the one may be compared perhaps to a continued stream of
honeyed sound, while that of the other is like the tremulous bubbles
that float and rise above its surface. Or Miss Tree’s singing has the
consistency, the lengthened tenuity or breadth of tone, drawn from a
well-strung violin, as Miss Stephens’s resembles the light, liquid,
echoing accompaniments of the harp or lute. Of both together, it
may be said, when they join their efforts in a single composition, that
‘All is grace above, while all is strength below.’ It is a treat to
which of late we have been seldom accustomed.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Mr. Kean’s Coriolanus.</span>—Mr. Kean’s acting is not of the
patrician order; he is one of the people, and what might be termed
a <i>radical</i> performer. He can do all that may become a man ‘of
our infirmity,’ ‘to relish all as sharply, passioned as we;’ but he
cannot play a God, or one who fancies himself a God, and who
is sublime, not in the strength of his own feelings, but in his contempt
for those of others, and in his imaginary superiority to them. That
is, he cannot play Coriolanus so well as he plays some other characters,
or as we have seen it played often. Wherever there was
a struggle of feelings, a momentary ebullition of pity, or remorse,
or anguish, wherever nature resumed her wonted rights, Mr. Kean
was equal to himself, and superior to every one else; but the prevailing
characteristics of the part are inordinate self-opinion, and haughty
elevation of soul, that aspire above competition or controul, as the
tall rock lifts its head above the skies, and is not bent or shattered
by the storm, beautiful in its unconquered strength, terrible in its
unaltered repose. Mr. Kean, instead of ‘keeping his state,’ instead
of remaining fixed and immoveable (for the most part) on his pedestal
of pride, seemed impatient of this mock-dignity, this <i>still-life</i> assumption
of superiority; burst too often from the trammels of precedent,
and the <i>routine</i> of etiquette, which should have confined him; and
descended into the common arena of man, to make good his pretensions
by the energy with which he contended for them, and to prove the
hollowness of his supposed indifference to the opinion of others by the
excessive significance and studied variations of the scorn and disgust
he expressed for it. The intolerable airs and aristocratical pretensions
of which he is the slave, and to which he falls a victim, did not seem
<i>legitimate</i> in him, but upstart, turbulent, and vulgar. Thus his haughty
answer to the mob who banish him—‘I banish you’—was given with
all the virulence of execration, and rage of impotent despair, as if he
had to strain every nerve and faculty of soul to shake off the contamination
of their hated power over him, instead of being delivered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>with calm, majestic self-possession, as if he remained rooted to the
spot, and his least motion, word, or look, must scatter them like
chaff or scum from his presence! The most effective scene was
that in which he stands for the Consulship, and begs for ‘the most
sweet voices’ of the people whom he loathes; and the most ineffective
was that in which he is reluctantly reconciled to, and over-come by
the entreaties of, his mother. This decisive and affecting interview
passed off as if nothing had happened, and was conducted with
diplomatic gravity and skill. The casting of the other parts was a
climax in bathos. Mr. Gattie was Menenius, the friend of Coriolanus,
and Mr. Penley Tullus Aufidius, his mortal foe. Mr. Pope should
have played the part. One would think there were processions and
ovations enough in this play, as it was acted in John Kemble’s time;
but besides these, there were introduced others of the same sort,
some of which were lengthened out as if they would reach all the
way to the Circus; and there was a sham-fight, of melodramatic
effect, in the second scene, in which Mr. Kean had like to have lost
his voice. There was throughout a continual din of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

<p class='c022'>or what was very like it. In the middle of an important scene, the
tinkling of the stage-bell was employed to announce a flourish of
trumpets—a thing which even Mr. Glossup would not hear of,
whatever the act of parliament might say to enforce such a puppet-show
accompaniment. There is very bad management in all this;
and yet Mr. Elliston is the manager.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Minor Theatres.</span>—This is a subject on which we shall treat, with
satisfaction to ourselves, and, we hope, to the edification of the
reader. Indeed, we are not a little vain of the article we propose to
write on this occasion; and we feel the pen in our hands flutter its
feathered down with more than its usual specific levity, at the thought
of the idle, careless career before it. No Theatre-Royal oppresses
the imagination, and entombs it in a mausoleum of massy pride; no
manager’s pompous pretensions choak up the lively current of our
blood: no long-announced performance, big with expectation, comes
to nothing, and yet compels us gravely to record its failure, and
compose its epitaph. We have here ‘ample scope and verge enough;’
we pick and chuse as we will, light where we please, and stay no
longer than we have a mind—saying ‘this I like, that I loath, as one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>picks pears:’—hover over the Surry Theatre; or snatch a grace
beyond the reach of art from the Miss Dennett’s at the Adelphi; or
take a peep (like the Devil upon Two Sticks) at Mr. Booth at the
Cobourg—and one peep is sufficient:—Or stretch our legs and strain
our fancies (as a pure voluntary exercise of dramatic faith and
charity) as far as Mr. Rae and the East London, where Mrs. Gould
(late Miss Burrell), makes fine work with Don Giovanni and the
Furies! We are not, in this case, to be ‘constrained by mastery.’—Escaped
from under the more immediate inspection of the Lord
Chamberlain’s eye, fastidious objections, formal method, regular
details, strict moral censure, cannot be expected at our hands: our
‘speculative and officed instruments’ may be well laid aside for a
time. At sight of the purlieus of taste, and suburbs of the drama,
criticism ‘clappeth his wings, and straitway he is gone!’ In short,
we feel it as our bounden duty to strike a truce with gravity, and give
a furlough to fancy; and, in entering on this part of our subject, to
let our thoughts wander over it, sport and trifle with it at pleasure,
like the butter-fly of whom Spenser largely and loftily sings in his
Muiopotmos.—</p>

(or what shall) from dropping down from the verge of the metropolis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>into the haunts of the provincial drama;—from taking coach to Bath
or Brighton, or visiting the Land’s-End, or giving an account of
Botany-bay theatricals, or the establishment of a new theatre at
Venezuela? One reason that makes the Minor Theatres interesting
is, that they are the connecting link, that lets us down, by an easy
transition, from the highest pomp and proudest display of the Thespian
art, to its first rudiments and helpless infancy.—With conscious happy
retrospect, they lead the eye back, along the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vista</span></i> of the imagination,
to the village barn, or travelling booth, or old-fashioned town-hall, or
more genteel assembly-room, in which Momus first unmasked to us
his fairy revels, and introduced us, for the first time in our lives, to
that strange anomaly in existence, that fanciful reality, that gay waking
dream, <i>a company of strolling players</i>! Sit still, draw close together,
hold in your breath—not a word, not a whisper—the laugh is ready
to start away, ‘like greyhound on the slip,’ the big tear of wonder
and expectation is ready to steal down ‘the full eyes and fair cheeks
of childhood,’ almost before the time. Only another moment, and
amidst blazing tapers, and the dancing sounds of music, and light
throbbing hearts, and eager looks, the curtain rises, and the picture
of the world appears before us in all its glory and in all its freshness.
Life throws its gaudy shadow across the stage; Hope shakes his
many-coloured wings, ‘embalmed with odours;’ Joy claps his hands,
and laughs in a hundred happy faces. Oh childish fancy, what a
mighty empire is thine; what endless creations thou buildest out of
nothing; what ‘a wide O’ indeed, thou chusest to act thy thoughts,
and unrivalled feats upon! Thou art better than the gilt trophy that
decks the funeral pall of kings; thou art brighter than the costly
mace that precedes them on their coronation-day. Thy fearfullest
visions are enviable happiness; thy wildest fictions are the solidest
truths. Thou art the only reality. All other possessions mock our
idle grasp: but thou performest by promising; thy smile is fruition;
thy blandishments are all that we can fairly call our own; thou art
the balm of life, the heaven of childhood, the poet’s idol, and the
player’s pride! The world is but thy painting; and the stage is
thine enchanted mirror.—When it first displays its shining surface to
our view, how glad, how surprised are we! We have no thought of
any deception in the scene, no wish but to realize it ourselves with
inconsiderate haste and fond impatience. We say to the air-drawn
gorgeous phantom, ‘Come, let me clutch thee!’ A new sense comes
upon us, the scales fall off our eyes, and the scenes of life start out in
endless quick succession crowded with men and women-actors, such
as we see before us—comparable to ‘those gay creatures of the
element, that live in the rainbow, and play i’ th’ plighted clouds!’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>Happy are we who look on and admire; and happy, we think, must
they be who are so looked at and admired; and sometimes we begin
to feel uneasy till we can ourselves mingle in the gay, busy, talking,
fluttering, powdered, painted, perfumed, peruked, quaintly-accoutred
throng of coxcombs and coquettes,—of tragedy heroes or heroines,—in
good earnest; or turn stage-players and represent them in
jest, with all the impertinent and consequential airs of the originals!</p>

<p class='c021'>It is no insignificant epoch in one’s life the first time that odd-looking
thing, a play-bill, is left at our door in a little market-town in
the country (say W—m in S——shire). The Manager, somewhat
fatter and more erect, ‘as Manager beseems,’ than the rest of his
Company, with more of the man of business, and not less of the
coxcomb, in his strut and manner, knocks at the door with the end
of a walking cane (a badge of office!) and a bundle of papers under
his arm; presents one of them printed in large capitals, with a
respectful bow and a familiar shrug; hopes to give satisfaction in the
town; hints at the liberal encouragement they received at W——ch,
the last place they stopped at; had every possible facility afforded by
the Magistrates; supped one evening with the Rev. Mr. J——s, a
dissenting clergyman, and really a very well-informed, agreeable,
sensible man, full of anecdote—no illiberal prejudices against the
profession:—then talks of the strength of his company, with a careless
mention of his own favourite line—his benefit fixed for an early day,
but would do himself the honour to leave farther particulars at a
future opportunity—speaks of the stage as an elegant amusement, that
most agreeably enlivened a spare evening or two in the week, and,
under proper management (to which he himself paid the most
assiduous attention) might be made of the greatest assistance to the
cause of virtue and humanity—had seen Mr. Garrick act the last
night but one before his retiring from the stage—had himself had
offers from the London boards, and indeed could not say he had
given up all thoughts of one day surprising them—as it was, had no
reason to repine—Mrs. F—— tolerably advanced in life—his eldest
son a prodigious turn for the higher walks of tragedy—had said
perhaps too much of himself—had given universal satisfaction—hoped
that the young gentleman and lady, at least, would attend on the
following evening, when the West-Indian would be performed at the
market-hall, with the farce of No Song No Supper—and so having
played his part, withdraws in the full persuasion of having made a
favourable impression, and of meeting with every encouragement the
place affords! Thus he passes from house to house, and goes
through the routine of topic after topic, with that sort of modest
assurance, which is indispensable in the manager of a country theatre.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>This fellow, who floats over the troubles of life as the froth above
the idle wave, with all his little expedients and disappointments, with
pawned paste-buckles, mortgaged scenery, empty exchequer, and
rebellious orchestra, is not of all men the most miserable:—he is
little less happy than a king, though not much better off than a
beggar. He has little to think of, much to do, more to say; and is
accompanied, in his incessant daily round of trifling occupations, with
a never-failing sense of authority and self-importance, the one thing
needful (above all others) to the heart of man. This however is
their man of business in the company; he is a sort of fixture in their
little state; like Nebuchadnezzar’s image, but half of earth and half
of finer metal: he is not ‘of imagination all compact:’ he is not, like
the rest of his aspiring crew, a feeder upon air, a drinker of applause,
tricked out in vanity and in nothing else; he is not quite mad, nor
quite happy. The whining Romeo, who goes supperless to bed, and
on his pallet of straw dreams of a crown of laurel, of waving handkerchiefs,
of bright eyes, and billet-doux breathing boundless love:
the ranting Richard, whose infuriate execrations are drowned in the
shouts of the all-ruling pit; he who, without a coat to his back, or a
groat in his purse, snatches at Cato’s robe, and binds the diadem of
Cæsar on his brow;—these are the men that Fancy has chosen for
herself, and placed above the reach of fortune, and almost of fate.
They take no thought for the morrow. What is it to them what
they shall eat, or what they shall drink, or how they shall be clothed?
‘Their mind to them a kingdom is.’—It is not a poor ten shillings a
week, their share in the profits of the theatre, with which they have
to pay for bed, board, and lodging, that bounds their wealth. They
share (and not unequally) in all the wealth, the pomp, and pleasures
of the world. They wield sceptres, conquer kingdoms, court
princesses, are clothed in purple, and fare sumptuously every night.
They taste, in imagination, ‘of all earth’s bliss, both living and loving:’
whatever has been most the admiration or most the envy of mankind,
they, for a moment, in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others,
become. The poet fancies others to be this or that; the player
fancies himself to be all that the poet but describes. A little rouge
makes him a lover, a plume of feathers a hero, a brazen crown an
emperor. Where will you buy rank, office, supreme delights, so
cheap as at his shop of fancy? Is it nothing to dream whenever we
please, and <i>seem</i> whatever we desire? Is real greatness, is real
prosperity, more than what it seems? Where shall we find, or
where shall the votary of the stage find, Fortunatus’s Wishing Cap,
but in the wardrobe which we laugh at: or borrow the philosopher’s
stone but from the <i>property-man</i> of the theatre? He has discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>the true Elixir of Life, which is freedom from care: he quaffs the
pure <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurum potabile</span></i>, which is popular applause. He who is smit with
the love of this <i>ideal</i> existence, cannot be weaned from it. Hoot him
from the stage, and he will stay to sweep the lobbies or shift the
scenes. Offer him twice the salary to go into a counting-house, or
stand behind a counter, and he will return to poverty, steeped in
contempt, but eked out with fancy, at the end of a week. Make a
laughing-stock of an actress, lower her salary, tell her she is too tall,
awkward, stupid, and ugly; try to get rid of her all you can—she
will remain, only to hear herself courted, to listen to the echo of
her borrowed name, to live but one short minute in the lap of
vanity and tinsel shew. Will you give a man an additional ten
shillings a week, and ask him to resign the fancied wealth of the
world, which he ‘by his so potent art’ can conjure up, and glad his
eyes, and fill his heart with it? When a little change of dress, and
the muttering a few talismanic words, make all the difference between
the vagabond and the hero, what signifies the interval so easily passed?
Would you not yourself consent to be alternately a beggar and a
king, but that you have not the secret skill to be so? The player
has that ‘happy alchemy of mind:’—why then would you reduce
him to an equality with yourself?—The moral of this reasoning is
known and felt, though it may be gainsayed. Wherever the players
come, they send a welcome before them, and leave an air in the place
behind them.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c015'><sup>[41]</sup></a> They shed a light upon the day, that does not very
soon pass off. See how they glitter along the street, wandering, not
where business but the bent of pleasure takes them, like mealy-coated
butterflies, or insects flitting in the sun. They seem another, happier,
idler race of mortals, prolonging the carelessness of childhood to old
age, floating down the stream of life, or wafted by the wanton breeze
to their final place of rest. We remember one (we must make the
reader acquainted with him) who once overtook us loitering by
‘Severn’s sedgy side,’ on a fine May morning, with a score of
play-bills streaming from his pockets, for the use of the neighbouring
villages, and a music-score in his hand, which he sung blithe and
clear, advancing with light step and a loud voice! With a sprightly
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon jour</span></i>, he passed on, carolling to the echo of the babbling stream,
brisk as a bird, gay as a mote, swift as an arrow from a twanging bow,
heart-whole, and with shining face that shot back the sun’s broad
rays!—What is become of this favourite of mirth and song? Has
care touched him? Has death tripped up his heels? Has an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>indigestion imprisoned him, and all his gaiety, in a living dungeon?
Or is he himself lost and buried amidst the rubbish of one of our
larger, or else of one of our Minor Theatres?</p>

      <div class='line'>——‘Alas! how changed from him,</div>
      <div class='line'>That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>But as this was no doubt the height of his ambition, why should we
wish to debar him of it?</p>

<p class='c021'>This brings us back, after our intended digression, to the subject
from whence we set out,—the smaller theatres of the metropolis;
which we visited lately, in hopes to find in them a romantic contrast
to the presumptuous and exclusive pretensions of the legitimate drama,
and to revive some of the associations of our youth above described.—The
first attempt we made was at the Cobourg, and we were completely
baulked. Judge of our disappointment. This was not owing,
we protest, to any fault or perversity of our own; to the crust and
scales of formality which had grown over us; to the panoply of
criticism in which we go armed, and which made us inaccessible to
‘pleasure’s finest point;’ or to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-fris</span></i> of objections, which
cut us off from all cordial participation in what was going forward on
the stage. No such thing. We went not only willing, but determined
to be pleased. We had laid aside the pedantry of rules, the
petulance of sarcasm, and had hoped to open once more, by stealth,
the source of sacred tears, of bubbling laughter, and concealed sighs.
We were not formidable. On the contrary, we were ‘made of
penetrable stuff.’ Stooping from our pride of place, we were ready
to be equally delighted with a clown in a pantomime, or a lord-mayor
in a tragedy. We were all attention, simplicity, and enthusiasm.
But we saw neither attention, simplicity, nor enthusiasm in any body
else; and our whole scheme of voluntary delusion and social enjoyment
was cut up by the roots. The play was indifferent, but that
was nothing. The acting was bad, but that was nothing. The
audience were low, but that was nothing. It was the heartless
indifference and hearty contempt shown by the performers for their
parts, and by the audience for the players and the play, that disgusted
us with all of them. Instead of the rude, naked, undisguised expression
of curiosity and wonder, of overflowing vanity and unbridled
egotism, there was nothing but an exhibition of the most petulant
cockneyism and vulgar slang. All our former notions and theories
were turned topsy-turvy. The genius of St. George’s Fields prevailed,
and you felt yourself in a bridewell, or a brothel, amidst
Jew-boys, pickpockets, prostitutes, and mountebanks, instead of being
in the precincts of Mount Parnassus, or in the company of the Muses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>The object was not to admire or to excel, but to vilify and degrade
every thing. The audience did not hiss the actors (that would have
implied a serious feeling of disapprobation, and something like a disappointed
wish to be pleased) but they laughed, hooted at, nick-named,
pelted them with oranges and witticisms, to show their unruly contempt
for them and their art; while the performers, to be even with
the audience, evidently slurred their parts, as if ashamed to be thought
to take any interest in them, laughed in one another’s faces, and in
that of their friends in the pit, and most effectually marred the process
of theatrical illusion, by turning the whole into a most unprincipled
burlesque. We cannot help thinking that some part of this indecency
and licentiousness is to be traced to the diminutive size of these
theatres, and to the close contact into which these unmannerly
censors come with the objects of their ignorant and unfeeling scorn.
Familiarity breeds contempt. By too narrow an inspection, you take
away that fine, hazy medium of abstraction, by which (in moderation)
a play is best set off: you are, as it were, admitted behind the scenes;
‘see the puppets dallying;’ shake hands, across the orchestra, with an
actor whom you know, or take one you do not like by the beard,
with equal impropriety:—you distinguish the paint, the individual
features, the texture of the dresses, the patch-work and machinery by
which the whole is made up; and this in some measure destroys the
effect, distracts attention, suspends the interest, and makes you disposed
to quarrel with the actors as impostors, and ‘not the men you
took them for.’ You here see Mr. Booth, in Brutus, with every
motion of his face <i>articulated</i>, with his under-jaws grinding out
sentences, and his upper-lip twitching at words and syllables, as if a
needle and thread had been passed through each corner of it, and the
<i>gude wife</i> still continued sewing at her work:—you perceive the contortion
and barrenness of his expression (in which there is only one
form of bent brows, and close pent-up mouth for all occasions) the
parsimony of his figure is exposed, and the refuse tones of his voice
fall with undiminished vulgarity on the pained ear:—you have
Mr. Higman as Prior Aymer in Ivanhoe, who used to play the
Gipsey so well at Covent-garden in Guy Mannering, and who
certainly is an admirable bass singer: you have Mr. Stanley, from
the Theatre-Royal, Bath, and whom we thought an interesting actor
there (such as poor Wilson might have been who trod the same
boards, and with whom our readers will remember that Miss Lydia
Melford, in Humphrey Clinker, fell in love):—you have Mr.
Barrymore, that old and deserving favourite with the public in the
best days of Mrs. Siddons and of John Kemble, superintending, we
believe, the whole, from a little oval window in a stage-box, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>Mr. Bentham eying the hopeful circle of delinquents in his Panopticon:—and,
to sum up all in one word, you have here Mr. H.
Kemble, whose hereditary gravity is put to the last test, by the yells
and grins of the remorseless rabble.</p>

<p class='c021'>‘My soul turn from them!’—‘Turn we to survey’ where the
Miss Dennetts, at the Adelphi Theatre, (which should once more
from them be called the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sans Pareil</span></i>) weave the airy, the harmonious,
liquid dance. Of each of them it might be said, and we believe has
been said—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Her, lovely Venus at a birth</div>
      <div class='line'>With two Sister Graces more</div>
      <div class='line'>To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Such figures, no doubt, gave rise to the fables of ancient mythology,
and might be worshipped. They revive the ideas of classic grace,
life, and joy. They do not seem like taught dancers, Columbines,
and figurantes on an artificial stage; but come bounding forward like
nymphs in vales of Arcady, or, like Italian shepherdesses, join in a
lovely group of easy gracefulness, while ‘vernal airs attune the
trembling leaves’ to their soft motions. If they were nothing in
themselves, they would be complete in one another. Each owes a
double grace, youth, and beauty, to her reflection in the other two.
It is the principle of proportion or harmony personified. To deny
their merit or criticise their style, is to be blind and dead to the
felicities of art and nature. Not to feel the force of their united
charms (united, yet divided, different, and yet the same), is not to
see the beauty of ‘three red roses on a stalk,’—or of the mingled hues
of the rainbow, or of the halcyon’s breast, reflected in the stream,—or
‘the witchery of the soft blue sky,’ or grace in the waving of the
branch of a tree, or tenderness in the bending of a flower, or liveliness
in the motion of a wave of the sea. We shall not try to defend them
against the dancing-school critics; there is another school, different
from that of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied a plomb</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirouette</span></i> cant, the school of taste and
nature. In this school, the Miss Dennetts are (to say the least)
delicious novices. Theirs is the only performance on the stage (we
include the Opera) that gives the uninitiated spectator an idea that
dancing can be an emanation of instinctive gaiety, or express the
language of sentiment. We might shew them to the Count Stendhal,
who speaks so feelingly of the beauties of a dance by Italian peasant
girls, as our three English Graces; and we might add, as a farther
proof of national liberality and public taste, that they had been discarded
from one of our larger, to take refuge in one of our petty
theatres, on a disagreement about a pound a week in their joint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>salaries. Yet we suppose if these young ladies were to marry, and
not volunteer to put ten thousand pounds in the pockets of some
liberally disposed manager, we should hear a very pitiful story of their
ingratitude to their patrons and the public. It is the way of the
world. There is a Mr. Reeve at this theatre (the Adelphi in the
Strand) of whom report had spoken highly in his particular department
as a mimic, and in whom we were considerably disappointed.
He is not so good as Matthews, who, after all, is by no means a
<i>fac-simile</i> of those he pretends to represent. We knew most of
Mr. Reeve’s likenesses, and that is the utmost we can say in their
praise; for we thought them very bad ones. They were very slight,
and yet contrived to be very disagreeable. Farren was the most
amusing, from a certain oddity of voice and manner in the ingenious
and eccentric original. Harley, again, was not at all the thing.
There was something of the external dress and deportment, but none
of the spirit, the frothy essence. He made him out a great burly
swaggering ruffian, instead of being what he is—a pleasant, fidgetty
person, pert as a jack-daw, light as a grasshopper. In short, from
having seen Mr. Reeve, no one would wish to see Mr. Harley,
though there is no one who has seen him but wishes to see him again;
and, though mimicry has the privilege of turning into ridicule the
loftier pretensions of tragic heroes, we believe it always endeavours to
set off the livelier peculiarities of comic ones in the most agreeable
light. Mr. Kean was bad enough. It might have been coarse and
repulsive enough, and yet like; but it wanted point and energy, and
this was inexcusable. We have heard much of ludicrous and
admirable imitations of Mr. Kean’s acting. But the only person
who ever caricatures Mr. Kean well, or from whose exaggerations
he has any thing to fear, is himself. There are several other actors
at the Adelphi who are, and must continue to be, nameless. There
are also some better known to the town, as Mr. Wilkinson, Mrs.
Alsop, etc. This lady has lost none of her exuberant and piquant
vivacity by her change of situation. She also looks much the same:
and as you see her near, this circumstance is by no means to her
advantage. The truth is, that there are not good actors or agreeable
actresses enough in town to make one really good company
(by which we mean a company able to get up any one really good
play throughout) and of course there are not a sufficient number
(unless by a miracle) to divide into eight or ten different establishments.</p>

<p class='c021'>Of the Haymarket and Lyceum, which come more properly under
the head of <i>Summer Theatres</i>, it is not at present ‘our hint to speak’;
but we may shortly take a peep into the Surrey and East London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Theatres,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c015'><sup>[42]</sup></a> and enlarge upon them as we see cause. Of the latter it
is sufficient to observe, that Mr. Rae is the principal tragic actor
there, and Mr. Peter Moore the chief manager. After this, is it to
be wondered at that Covent-garden is almost deserted, and that Mr.
Elliston cannot yet afford to give up the practice of puffing at the
bottom of his play-bills!</p>

<p class='c021'>The larger, as well as the smaller, theatres have been closed during
the greater part of the last month. There has been one new piece,
the <cite>Antiquary</cite>, brought out at Covent-garden, since our last report.
It is founded, as our readers will suppose, on the admirable novel of
that name by the author of Waverley, but it is only a slight sketch of
the story and characters, and not, we think, equal to the former
popular melo-drames taken from the same prolific source. The
characters in general were not very intelligibly brought out, nor very
strikingly cast. Liston made but an indifferent Mr. Jonathan Oldbuck.
He was dressed in a snuff-coloured coat and plain bob-wig,
and that was all. It was quaint and dry, and accordingly inefficient,
and quite unlike his admirable portrait of Dominie Sampson, which
is one of the finest pieces of acting on the stage, both for humour and
feeling, invention and expression. The little odd ways and antiquarian
whims and crochets of Mr. Oldbuck, even were they as well
managed in the drama as they are exquisitely hit off in the novel,
would hardly tell in Liston’s hands. Emery made an impressive
Edie Ochiltree; but he was somewhat too powerful a preacher, and
too sturdy a beggar. Mr. Abbott personated the haughty, petulant
Captain MacIntire to a great nicety of resemblance. Mr. Duruset
as young Lovell ‘warbled’ in a manner that Jacques would not have
found fault with. Miss Stephens sang one or two airs very sweetly,
and was complimented at the end very rapturously and unexpectedly
by the <i>ungallant</i> Mr. Oldbuck. The scene on the sea-shore, where
she is in danger of being overtaken by the tide, with her father and
old Edie, had an admirable effect, as far as the imitation of the rolling
of the waves of the sea on a London stage could produce admiration.
The part of old Elspith of Craigie Burn Wood was strikingly performed
by Mrs. Fawcett, who, indeed, acts whatever she undertakes
well; and the scene with Lord Glenallan, in which she unfolds to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>him the dreadful story of his life, was given at much length and with
considerable effect. But what can come up to the sublime, heartbreaking
pathos, the terrific painting of the original work? The
story of this unhappy feudal lord is the most harrowing in all these
novels (rich as they are in the materials of nature and passion): and
the description of the old woman, who had been a principal subordinate
instrument in the tragedy, is done with a more masterly and
withering hand than any other. Her death-like appearance, her
strange existence, like one hovering between this world and the next,
or like a speaking corpse; her fixed attitude, her complete forgetfulness
of every thing but the one subject that loads her thoughts, her
preternatural self-possession on that, her prophetic and awful denunciations,
her clay-cold and shrivelled body, consumed and kept alive by
a wasting fire within, are all given with a subtlety, a truth, a boldness
and originality of conception, that were never, perhaps, surpassed.
But the author does not want our praise; nor can we withhold from
him our admiration.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kean, the week before we saw him in Coriolanus, played
Othello; and as we would always prefer bearing testimony to his
genius, to recording his comparative failures, we will here express
our opinion of his performance of this character in the words of a
contemporary journal, a short time back:—</p>

<p class='c024'>Mr. Kean’s Othello is, we suppose, the finest piece of acting in the
world. It is impossible either to describe or praise it adequately. We
have never seen any actor so wrought upon, so ‘perplexed in the extreme.’
The energy of passion, as it expresses itself in action, is not the most terrific
part: it is the agony of his soul, showing itself in looks and tones of voice.
In one part, where he listens in dumb despair to the fiend-like insinuations
of Iago, he presented the very face, the marble aspect of Dante’s Count
Ugolino. On his fixed eye-lids, ‘horror sat plumed.’ In another part,
where a gleam of hope or of tenderness returns to subdue the tumult of his
passions, his voice broke in faltering accents from his over-charged breast.
His lips might be said less to utter words, than to distil drops of blood,
gushing from his heart. An instance of this was in his pronunciation of
the line, ‘of one that loved not wisely but too well.’ The whole of this
last speech was indeed given with exquisite force and beauty. We only
object to the virulence with which he delivers the last line, and with which
he stabs himself—a virulence which Othello would neither feel against himself
at the moment, nor against the ‘turbaned Turk’ (whom he had slain)
at such a distance at time. His exclamation on seeing his wife, ‘I cannot
think but Desdemona’s honest,’ was, ‘the glorious triumph of exceeding
love’; a thought flashing conviction on his mind, and irradiating his
countenance with joy, like sudden sunshine. In fact, almost every scene
or sentence in this extraordinary exhibition is a master-piece of natural
passion. The convulsed motion of the hands, and the involuntary swelling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>of the veins in the forehead in some of the most painful situations, should
not only suggest topics of critical panegyric, but might furnish studies to
the painter or anatomist.</p>

<h3 class='c008'>No. IV</h3>

<div class='c031'>[<i>April, 1820.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>The age we live in is critical, didactic, paradoxical, romantic, but
it is not dramatic. This, if any, is its weak side: it is there that
modern literature does not run on all fours, nor triumph over the
periods that are past; it halts on one leg; and is fairly distanced
by long-acknowledged excellence, as well as by long-forgotten efforts
of the same kind. Our ancestors could write a tragedy two hundred
years ago; they could write a comedy one hundred years ago; why
cannot we do the same now? It is hard to say; but so it is. When
we give it as our opinion, that this is not ‘the high and palmy state’
of the productions of the stage, we would be understood to signify,
that there has hardly been a good tragedy or a good comedy written
within the last fifty years, that is, since the time of Home’s Douglas,
and Sheridan’s School for Scandal; and when we speak of a good
tragedy or comedy, we mean one that will be thought so fifty years
hence. Not that we would have it supposed, that a work, to be
worth any thing, must last always: what we have said above of works
that have fallen into unmerited decay, through the lapse of time, and
mutation of circumstances, would show the contrary: but we think
that a play that only runs its one-and-twenty nights, that does not
reach beyond the life of an actor, or the fashion of a single generation,
may be fairly set down as good for nothing, to any purposes of
criticism, or serious admiration. Time seems to have its circle as
well as the globe we inhabit; the loftiest eminences, by degrees, sink
beneath the horizon; the greatest works are lost sight of in the end,
and cannot be restored; but those that disappear at the first step we
take, or are hidden by the first object that intervenes, can, in either
case, be of no real magnitude or importance. We have never seen the
highest range of mountains in the world; nor are the longest-lived
works intelligible to us (from the difference both of language and
manners) at this day: but the name of the Andes, like that of old,
blind Homer, serves us on this side of the globe, and at the lag-end
of time, to repeat and wonder at; and that we have ever heard of
either is alone sufficient proof of the vastness of the one, and of the
sublimity of the other! Without waiting for the final award, or
gradual oblivion of slow-revolving ages, we may be bold to say of
our writers for the stage, during the last twenty or thirty years, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Pope is reported to have said of Ben Jonson’s, somewhat unadvisedly,
‘What trash are <i>their</i> works, taken altogether!’ We would not
deny or depreciate merit, wherever we find it, in individuals, or in
classes: for instance, we grant that all the pantomimes are good in
which Mr. Grimaldi plays the clown; and that the melodrames
have been excellent, when Mr. Farley had a hand in them; and
that the farces could not be damned if Munden showed his face
in them; and that O’Keeffe’s could not fail with an audience that
had a mind to laugh: but having mentioned these, and added a few
more to our private list (for it might be invidious to specify particularly
No Song no Supper, the Prize, Goldfinch, Robert Tyke,
or Lubin Log, &amp;c. &amp;c.), we really are at a loss to proceed with
the more legitimate and higher productions of the modern drama.
Are there not then Mr. Coleridge’s Remorse, Mr. Maturin’s
Bertram, Mr. Milman’s Fazio, and many others? There are;
but we do not know that they make any difference in the question.
The poverty indeed of our present dramatic genius cannot be made
appear more fully than by this, that whatever it has to show of
<i>profound</i>, is of German taste and origin; and that what little it can
boast of <i>elegant</i>, though light and vain, is taken from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite</span></i> pieces of
Parisian mould.</p>

<p class='c021'>We have been long trying to find out the meaning of all this, and at
last we think we have succeeded. The cause of the evil complained of,
like the root of so many other grievances and complaints, lies in the
French revolution. That event has rivetted all eyes, and distracted
all hearts; and, like people staring at a comet, in the panic and
confusion in which we have been huddled together, we have not
had time to laugh at one another’s defects, or to condole over one
another’s misfortunes. We have become a nation of politicians and
newsmongers; our inquiries in the streets are no less than after the
health of Europe; and in men’s faces, we may see strange matters
written,—the rise of stocks, the loss of battles, the fall of kingdoms,
and the death of kings. The Muse, meanwhile, droops in bye-corners
of the mind, and is forced to take up with the refuse of our
thoughts. Our attention has been turned, by the current of events,
to the general nature of men and things; and we cannot call it
heartily back to individual caprices, or head-strong passions, which
are the nerves and sinews of Comedy and Tragedy. What is an
individual man to a nation? Or what is a nation to an abstract
principle? The affairs of the world are spread out before us, as
in a map; we sit with the newspaper, and a pair of compasses in
our hand, to measure out provinces, and to dispose of thrones;
we ‘look abroad into universality,’ feel in circles of latitude and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>longitude, and cannot contract the grasp of our minds to scan with
nice scrutiny particular foibles, or to be engrossed by any single
suffering. What we gain in extent, we lose in force and depth.
A general and speculative interest absorbs the corroding poison,
and takes out the sting of our more circumscribed and fiercer
passions. We are become public creatures; ‘are embowelled of
our natural entrails, and stuffed,’ as Mr. Burke has it in his high-flown
phrase, ‘with paltry blurred sheets of paper about the rights
of man,’ or the rights of legitimacy. We break our sleep to argue
a question; a piece of news spoils our appetite for dinner. We
are not so solicitous after our own success as the success of a cause.
Our thoughts, feelings, distresses, are about what no way concerns
us, more than it concerns any body else, like those of the Upholsterer,
ridiculed as a new species of character in the Tatler: but we are
become a nation of upholsterers. We participate in the general
progress of intellect, and the large vicissitudes of human affairs;
but the hugest private sorrow looks dwarfish and puerile. In the
sovereignty of our minds, we make mankind our quarry; and, in
the scope of our ambitious thoughts, hunt for prey through the four
quarters of the world. In a word, literature and civilization have
abstracted man from himself so far, that his existence is no longer
<i>dramatic</i>; and the press has been the ruin of the stage, unless we
are greatly deceived.</p>

<p class='c021'>If a bias to abstraction is evidently, then, the reigning spirit of
the age, dramatic poetry must be allowed to be most irreconcileable
with this spirit; it is essentially individual and concrete, both in
form and in power. It is the closest imitation of nature; it has
a body of truth; it is ‘a counterfeit presentment’ of reality; for
it brings forward certain characters to act and speak for themselves,
in the most trying and singular circumstances. It is not enough for
them to declaim on certain general topics, however forcibly or
learnedly—this is merely oratory, and this any other characters
might do as well, in any other circumstances: nor is it sufficient for
the poet to furnish the colours and forms of style and fancy out of
his own store, however inexhaustible; for if he merely makes them
express his own feelings, and the idle effusions of his own breast, he
had better speak in his own person, without any of those troublesome
‘interlocutions between Lucius and Caius.’ The tragic poet (to be
truly such) can only deliver the sentiments of given persons, placed
in given circumstances; and in order to make what so proceeds from
their mouths, at once proper to them and interesting to the audience,
their characters must be powerfully marked: their passions, which
are the subject-matter of which they treat, must be worked up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>the highest pitch of intensity; and the circumstances which give force
and direction to them must be stamped with the utmost distinctness
and vividness in every line. Within the circle of dramatic character
and natural passion, each individual is to feel as keenly, as profoundly,
as rapidly as possible, but he is not to feel beyond it, for others or
for the whole. Each character, on the contrary, must be a kind of
centre of repulsion to the rest; and it is their hostile interests, brought
into collision, that must tug at their heart-strings, and call forth every
faculty of thought, of speech, and action. They must not be represented
like a set of profiles, looking all the same way, nor with their
faces turned round to the audience; but in dire contention with each
other: their words, like their swords, must strike fire from one
another,—must inflict the wound, and pour in the poison. The
poet, to do justice to his undertaking, must not only identify himself
with each, but must take part with all by turns, ‘to relish all as
sharply, passioned as they;’—must feel scorn, pity, love, hate, anger,
remorse, revenge, ambition, in their most sudden and fierce extremes,—must
not only have these passions rooted in his mind, but must be
alive to every circumstance affecting them, to every accident of
which advantage can be taken to gratify or exasperate them; a word
must kindle the dormant spark into a flame; an unforeseen event must
overturn his whole being <i>in conceipt</i>; it is from the excess of passion
that he must borrow the activity of his imagination; he must mould
the sound of his verse to its fluctuations and caprices, and build up
the whole superstructure of his fable on the deep and strict foundations
of nature. But surely it is hardly to be thought that the poet
should feel for others in this way, when they have ceased almost to
feel for themselves; when the mind is turned habitually out of itself
to general, speculative truth, and possibilities of good, and when, in
fact, the processes of the understanding, analytical distinctions, and
verbal disputes, have superseded all personal and local attachments
and antipathies, and have, in a manner, put a stop to the pulsation
of the heart—quenched the fever in the blood—the madness in the
brain;—when we are more in love with a theory than a mistress,
and would only crush to atoms those who are of an opposite party
to ourselves in taste, philosophy, or politics. The folds of self-love,
arising out of natural instincts, connections, and circumstances, have
not wound themselves exclusively and unconsciously enough round
the human mind to furnish the matter of impassioned poetry in real
life: much less are we to expect the poet, without observation of its
effects on others, or experience of them in himself, to supply the
imaginary form out of vague topics, general reflections, far-fetched
tropes, affected sentiments, and fine writing. To move the world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>he must have a place to fix the levers of invention upon. The poet
(let his genius be what it will) can only act by sympathy with the
public mind and manners of his age; but these are, at present, not
in sympathy, but in opposition to dramatic poetry. Therefore,
we have no dramatic poets. It would be strange indeed (under
favour be it spoken) if in the same period of time that produced
the Political Justice or the Edinburgh Review, there should be
found such an ‘unfeathered, two-legged thing’ as a real tragedy
poet.</p>

<p class='c021'>But it may be answered, that the author of the Enquiry concerning
Political Justice, is himself a writer of romances, and the author of
Caleb Williams. We hearken to the suggestion, and will take this
and one or two other eminent examples, to show how far we fall
short of the goal we aim at. ‘You may wear your bays with a
difference.’ Mr. Godwin has written an admirable and almost
unrivalled novel (nay, more than one)—he has also written two
tragedies, and failed. We can hardly think it would have been
possible for him to have failed, but on the principle here stated;
viz. that it was impossible for him to succeed. His genius is
wholly adverse to the stage. As an author, as a novel writer, he
may be considered as a philosophical recluse, a closet-hero. He
cannot be denied to possess the <i>constructive</i> organ, to have originality
and invention in an extraordinary degree: but he does not construct
according to nature; his invention is not dramatic. He takes a
character or a passion, and works it out to the utmost possible
extravagance, and palliates or urges it on by every resource of
the understanding, or by every species of plausible sophistry; but
in doing this, he may be said to be only spinning a subtle theory,
to be maintaining a wild paradox, as much as when he extends a
philosophical and abstract principle into all its ramifications, and
builds an entire and exclusive system of feeling and action on a
single daring view of human nature. ‘He sits in the centre’ of his
web, and ‘enjoys’ not ‘bright day,’ but a kind of gloomy grandeur.
His characters stand alone, self-created, and self-supported, without
communication with, or reaction upon, any other (except in the
single instance of Caleb Williams himself):—the passions are not
excited, qualified, or irritated by circumstances, but moulded by the
will of the writer, like clay in the hands of the potter. Mr. Godwin’s
imagination works like the power of steam, with inconceivable and
incessant expansive force; but it is all in one direction, mechanical
and uniform. By its help, he weaves gigantic figures, and unfolds
terrific situations; but they are like the cloudy pageantry that hangs
over the edge of day, and the prodigious offspring of his brain have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>neither fellow nor competitor in the scene of his imagination. They
require a clear stage to themselves. They do not enter the lists with
other men: nor are actuated by the ordinary wheels, pulleys, and
machinery of society: they are at issue with themselves, and at war
with the nature of things. Falkland, St. Leon, Mandeville, are studies
for us to contemplate, not men that we can sympathise with. They
move in an orbit of their own, urged on by restless thought and morbid
sentiment, on which the antagonist powers of sense, habit, circumstances,
and opinion have no influence whatever. The arguments
addressed to them are idle and ineffectual. You might as well argue
with a madman, or talk to the winds. But this is not the nature of
dramatic writing. Mr. Godwin, to succeed in tragedy, should compose
it almost entirely of long and repeated soliloquies, like the Prometheus
of Æschylus; and his dialogues, properly translated, would turn out
to be monologues, as we see in the Iron Chest.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c015'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>The same, or similar, remarks would apply to Mr. Wordsworth’s
hankering after the drama. We understand, that, like Mr. Godwin,
the author of the Lyric Ballads formerly made the attempt, and did
not receive encouragement to proceed. We cannot say positively:
but we much suspect that the writer would be for having all the talk
to himself. His moody sensibility would eat into the plot like a
cancer, and bespeak both sides of the dialogue for its own share.
Mr. Wordsworth (we are satisfied with him, be it remembered, as
he is), is not a man to go out of himself into the feelings of any one
else; much less, to act the part of a variety of characters. He is
not, like Bottom, ready to play the lady, the lover, and the lion.
His poetry is a virtual proscription passed upon the promiscuous
nature of the drama. He sees nothing but himself in the universe:
or if he leans with a kindly feeling to any thing else, he would impart
to the most uninteresting things the fulness of his own sentiments,
and elevate the most insignificant characters into the foremost rank,—before
kings, or heroes, or lords, or wits,—because they do not
interfere with his own sense of self-importance. He has none of
the bye-play, the varying points of view, the venturous magnanimity
of dramatic fiction. He thinks the opening of the leaves of a daisy,
or the perfume of a hedge (not of a garden) rose, matters of consequence
enough for him to notice them; but he thinks the ‘daily
intercourse of all this unintelligible world,’ its cares, its crimes, its
noise, love, war, ambition, (what else?) mere vanity and vexation of
spirit, with which a great poet cannot condescend to disturb the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>bright, serene, and solemn current of his thoughts. This lofty
indifference and contempt for his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i> would not be the
most likely means to make them interesting to the audience. We
fear Mr. Wordsworth’s poetical egotism would prevent his writing
a tragedy. Yet we have above made the dissipation and rarefaction
of this spirit in society, the bar to dramatic excellence. Egotism
is of different sorts; and he would not compliment the literary and
artificial state of manners so much, as to suppose it quite free from
this principle. But it is not allied at present to imagination or passion.
It is sordid, servile, inert, a compound of dulness, vanity, and interest.
That which is the source of dramatic excellence, is like a mountain
spring, full of life and impetuosity, sparkling with light, thundering
down precipices, winding along narrow defiles; or</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like a wild overflow, that sweeps before him</div>
      <div class='line'>A golden stack, and with it shakes down bridges,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cracks the strong hearts of pines, whose cable roots</div>
      <div class='line'>Held out a thousand storms, a thousand thunders,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so, made mightier, takes whole villages</div>

      <div class='line'>Charges strong towns, towers, castles, palaces,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lays them desolate.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The other sort is a stagnant, gilded puddle. Mr. Wordsworth has
measured it from side to side. ‘’Tis three feet long and two feet
wide.’—Lord Byron’s patrician haughtiness and monastic seclusion
are, we think, no less hostile than the levelling spirit of Mr. Wordsworth’s
Muse, to the endless gradations, variety, and complicated
ideas or <i>mixed modes</i> of this sort of composition. Yet we have read
Manfred.</p>

<p class='c021'>But what shall we say of Mr. Coleridge, who is the author not
only of a successful but a meritorious tragedy? We may say of him
what he has said of Mr. Maturin, that he is of the transcendental
German school. He is a florid poet, and an ingenious metaphysician,
who mistakes scholastic speculations for the intricate windings of the
passions, and assigns possible reasons instead of actual motives for the
excesses of his characters. He gives us studied special-pleadings
for involuntary bursts of feeling, and the needless strain of tinkling
sentiments for the point-blank language of nature. His Remorse is
a spurious tragedy. Take the following passage, and then ask,
whether the charge of sophistry and paradox, and dangerous morality,
to startle the audience, in lieu of more legitimate methods of exciting
their sympathy, which he brings against the author of Bertram, may
not be retorted on his own head. Ordonio is made to defend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the project of murdering his brother by such arguments as the
following:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Made room for these unnumber’d!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>This is a way in which no one ever justified a murder to his own
mind. No one will suspect Mr. Southey of writing a tragedy, nor
Mr. Moore either. His Muse is light. Walter Scott excels in the
grotesque and the romantic. He gives us that which has been
preserved of ancient manners and customs, and barbarous times and
characters, and which strikes and staggers the mind the more, by
the contrast it affords to the present artificial and effeminate state
of society. But we do not know that he could write a tragedy:
what he has engrafted of his own in this way upon the actual stock
and floating materials of history is, we think, inferior to the general
texture of his work. See, for instance, the conclusion of the Black
Dwarf, where the situation of the parties is as dramatic as possible,
and the effect is none at all. It is not a sound inference, that,
because parts of a novel are dramatic, the author could write a play.
The novelist is dramatic only where he can, and where he pleases;
the other must be so. The first is a <i>ride and tye</i> business, like a
gentleman leading his horse, or walking by the side of a gig down
a hill. We shall not, however, insist farther on this topic, because
we are not convinced that the author of Waverley could not write
a first-rate tragedy, as well as so many first-rate novels. If he can,
we wish that he would; and not leave it to others to mar what he
has sketched so admirably as a ground-work for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>The Hebrew, Ivanhoe, etc.</span>—We have been led to make these
general remarks, partly in consequence of the two new dramas, taken
from the romance of Ivanhoe, the one called Ivanhoe at Coventgarden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>and the other under the title of the Hebrew at Drury-lane.
It argues little for the force or redundance of our original talents for
tragic composition, when our authors of that description are periodical
pensioners on the bounty of the Scottish press; and when with all
the craving which the public and the Managers feel for novelty in
this respect, they can only procure it at second-hand by vamping up
with new scenery, decorations, and dresses, what has been already
rendered at once sacred and familiar to us in the closet. Mr.
Walter Scott no sooner conjures up the Muse of old romance, and
brings us acquainted with her in ancient hall, cavern, or mossy dell,
than Messrs. Harris and Elliston, with all their tribe, instantly set
their tailors to work to take the pattern of the dresses, their artists
to paint the wild-wood scenery or some proud dungeon-keep, their
musicians to compose the fragments of bewildered ditties, and their
penmen to connect the author’s scattered narrative and broken dialogue
into a sort of theatrical join-hand. The thing is not ill got up in
general; it fills the coffers of the theatre for a time; gratifies public
curiosity till another new novel appears; and probably flatters the
illustrious prose-writer, who must be fastidious indeed, if, at the end
of each representation, he exclaims with Hamlet, ‘I had as lief the
town-crier had spoken my lines!’—It has been observed by an
excellent judge, that it was next to impossible to spoil a picture
of Titian’s by copying it. Even the most indifferent wood-cut,
a few scratches in an etching, gave something of a superior look
of refinement, an air of grace and grandeur; the outline was so true,
the disposition of light and shade so masterly in the original, that it
could not be quite done away. So it is with these theatrical adaptations:
the spirit of the real author shines through them in spite of
many obstacles; and about a twentieth part of his genius appears in
them, which is enough. His canvas is cut down, to be sure; his
characters thinned out, the limbs and extremities of his plot are lopped
away (cruel necessity!), and it is like showing a brick for a house.
But then what is left is so fine! The author’s Muse is ‘instinct
with fire,’ in every part, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra poetæ</span></i>, like the
polypus when hacked and hewed asunder, piece together again, or
sprout out into new life. The other plays that we have seen taken
from this stock are merely selections and transpositions of the
borrowed materials: the Hebrew (we mean the principal character
itself) is the only excrescence from it; and though fantastic and
somewhat feeble, compared with the solid trunk from which it
grew, it is still no unworthy ornament to it, like the withered and
variegated moss upon the knotted oak.—Of Ivanhoe itself, we wish
to say a single word, before we proceed to either drama. It is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>first attempt of Mr. Scott (we wish the writer would either declare
himself, or give himself a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de guerre</span></i>, that we might speak of him
without either a periphrasis or impertinence) it is, we say, Mr. Scott’s
first attempt on English ground, and it is, we think, only a comparative,
but comparatively with himself, a decided failure. There are
some few scenes in it, and one or two extraneous characters, equal to
what he has before written; but we think they are, <i>in comparison</i>,
few; and by being so distinctly detached as they are, from the
general groundwork (so that no two persons taking the work to
dramatise would not pitch upon the same incidents and individuals
to bring forward on the stage) show that the other parts of the
story are without proportionable prominence and interest. In the
other novels it was not so. The variety, the continued interest,
the crowded groups, the ever-changing features distracted attention,
and perplexed the choice: the difficulty was not what to select, but
what to reject. All was new, and all was equally, or nearly equally,
good—teeming with life and throbbing with interest. But here, no
one, if called upon for a preference, can miss pointing out Friar Tuck
in his cell, and the Jew and his daughter Rebecca. These remain,
and stand out after the perusal, as above water mark; when the rest
are washed away and forgotten. For want of the same pulse, the
same veins of nature circling throughout, the body of the work is
cold and colourless. The author does not feel himself at home; and
tries to make up for cordial sympathy and bold action, by the minute
details of his subject—by finishing his Saxon draperies, or furbishing
up the armour of his Normans, with equal care and indifference—so
that we seem turning over a book of antiquarian prints, instead of the
pages of an admired novel-writer. In fact, we conceive, as a point
of speculative criticism, that the genius of the author of Waverley,
however lofty, and however extensive, still has certain discernible
limits; that it is strictly national; that it is traditional; that it
relies on actual manners and external badges of character; that it
insists on costume and dialect; and is one of individual character
and situation, rather than of general nature. This was some time
doubtful: but the present work ‘gives evidence of it.’ Compare his
Rob Roy with Robin Hood. What rich Highland blood flows
through the veins of the one; colours his hair, freckles his skin,
bounds in his step, swells in his heart, kindles in his eye: what poor
waterish puddle creeps through the soul of Locksley; and what a
lazy, listless figure he makes in his coat of Lincoln-green, like a figure
to let, in the novel of Ivanhoe! Mr. T. Cooke, of the Theatre
Royal, Drury-lane, does not make him much more insipid. Mr.
Scott slights and slurs our archer good. His imagination mounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>with Rob Roy, among his native wilds and cliffs, like an eagle to its
lordly nest: but it cannot take shelter with Robin Hood and <i>his</i> crew
of outlaws in the Forest of Merry Sherwood: ‘his affections do not
that way tend.’ Like a good patriot and an honest man, he feels
not the same interest in old English history, as in Scottish tradition;
the one is not bound up with his early impressions, with his local
knowledge, with his personal attachments, like the other; and we
may be allowed to say, that our author’s genius soars to its enviable
and exclusive height from the depth of his prejudices. He has
described Scottish manners, scenery, and history so well, and made
them so interesting to others, from his complete knowledge and
intense love of his country. Why should we expect him to describe
English manners and events as well? On his native soil, within that
hallowed circle of his warm affections and his keen observation, no
one will pretend to cope with him. He has there a wide and noble
range, over which his pen ‘holds sovereign sway and masterdom;’
to wit, over the Highlands and the Lowlands, and the Tolbooth and
the good town of Edinburgh, with ‘a far cry to Lochiel,’ over
gleaming lake and valley, and the bare mountain-path, over all ranks
and classes of his countrymen, high and low, and over all that has
happened to them for the last five hundred years, recorded in history,
tradition, or old song. These he may challenge for himself; and if
he throws down his gauntlet, no one but a madman will dare to take
it up. But on this side the Tweed we have others as good as he.
The genius of that magic stream may say to him, ‘Hitherto shalt
thou come, but no further.’ We have novels and romances of our
own as good as Ivanhoe; and we will venture to predict, that the
more this admirable and all but universal genius extends his rapid and
unresisted career on this side the border, the more he will lose in
reputation, and in real strength—</p>

<p class='c022'>How feeble, how slight, how unsatisfactory and disjointed, did the
adaptations from Guy Mannering, Rob Roy, and the Antiquary
appear, contrasted with the story we had read! The play of
Ivanhoe at Covent Garden, on the contrary, seems to give all (or
nearly so), that we remember distinctly in the novel; and the
Hebrew, which constantly wanders from it, without any apparent
object or meaning, yet does so without exciting much indignation
or regret. We have in both the scene, the indispensable scene, at
the hermitage of Copmanhurst, between the Black Knight, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>Robin Hood’s jolly Friar (which, however, has not half the effect
on the stage that it has in reading, though Mr. Emery plays the
Friar, and sings a jolly stave for him admirably well at Covent
Garden)—we have the trial of Rebecca, and the threat to put her
father to the torture, almost carried into execution at the castle of
Torquilstone; we have the siege and demolition of the castle itself;
we have the fair Rowena at one house, in her own proper shape;
and at the other, metamorphosed into the fairer and more lovely
Israelite; and at both we have Cedric the Saxon, Gurth the swineherd,
and Wamba the jester, and Brian de Bois-Guilbert; and what
more would any one require in reason? The details, however, of all
these personages and transactions are much more accurately given,
and more skilfully connected in Ivanhoe than in the Hebrew, and
the former play is better got up than the latter, in all the characters,
with the exception of one, which it is needless to mention. Yet,
why should we not, envy apart? Mr. Farren played Isaac of York,
well; Mr. Kean played the Hebrew still better. As for the rest,
Charles Kemble played the same character at one house that Mr.
Penley, Jun. did at the other: Mr. Emery was Friar Tuck at
Covent Garden, Mr. Oxberry at Drury Lane: Mr. Macready was
Sir Reginald Front de Bœuf, a character exactly fitted for his
impetuous action, and his smothered tremulous tones, which we
cannot say of his other representative, Mr. Hamblin, though we have
nothing to say against him: Miss Foote looked the beautiful Rebecca
(all but the raven locks and dark eye-lashes) which Mrs. West
played but insipidly, with Miss Carew to help her: and Mrs. Fawcett
was the wretched, but terrific daughter of the race of Torquilstone,
a character omitted at the other house. As a literary composition,
we have nothing to offer on Ivanhoe; but the Hebrew (which is
published, and which is from the pen of Mr. Soane, the author of
some former pieces which have been well received), requires a word
or two of remark. As a play, it is ill-constructed, without proportion
or connection. As a poem, it has its beauties, and those we
think neither mean nor few. It is disjointed, without dramatic
decorum, and sometimes even to a ludicrous degree: as where a
principal hero, on hearing the sound of a horn or trumpet, jumps
on a table to look out of a window, and receives an arrow in his
breast from one of the besiegers, on which he is carried out apparently
lifeless; and yet he is presently after introduced again, as well as if
no such accident had happened. But notwithstanding this, and many
other errors of the same kind, and a weakness and languor in the
general progress of the story, there are individual touches of nature
and passion, which we can account for in no other way so satisfactorily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>as by imagining the author to be a man of genius. The
flowers of poetry interspersed were often sad, but beautiful—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>the turns and starts of passion in feeble and wronged old age, were
often delicate and striking. Among these we might mention the
Jew’s comparison of his own feelings on receiving an unexpected
kindness, to the cold and icy current of the river frozen by the
winter, but melting in the genial warmth of the sun: his refusal,
in the wanderings of his intellect, to go to witness his daughter’s
death in company with any one else; ‘No: thou art not my child,
I’ll go alone:’ and the fine conception of his hearing, in the deep
and silent abstraction of his despair (before any one else), the sound
of the trampling of the champion’s steed, who comes to rescue her
from destruction, which is, however, nearly ruined and rendered
ridiculous by Mr. Penley’s running in with armour on from the
farthest end of the stage, as fast as his legs can carry him. Upon
the whole, this character, compared to the rough draught in the
novel, is like a curiously finished miniature, done after a bold and
noble design. For the dark, massy beard, and coarse weather-beaten
figure, which we attribute to Isaac of York, we have a few
sprinkled grey hairs, and the shrivelled, tottering frame of the
Hebrew; and Mr. Kean’s acting in it, in several places, was such
as to terrify us when we find from the play-bills that he is soon
to act Lear. Of the two plays, we would then recommend it to our
readers to go to see Ivanhoe at Covent Garden: but for ourselves,
we would rather see the Hebrew a second time at Drury Lane,
though every time we go there it costs us three and sixpence more
than at the other house—a serious sum! Notwithstanding this
repeated and heavy defalcation from our revenue, which really hurts
our vanity not less than our interest, we must do the Manager the
justice to say, that we never laughed more heartily than we did at
his Sir Charles and Lady Racket the other night. ‘Unkindness
may do much,’ but it is not a little matter that will hinder us from
laughing as long and as loud as any body, ‘to the very top of our
lungs,’ at so rich a treat as Three Weeks after Marriage. Mr.
Elliston never shines to more advantage than in light, genteel farce,
after Mr. Kean’s tragedy. ‘Do you think I’ll sleep with a woman
that doesn’t know what’s trumps?’ It was irresistible. It might
have been <i>encored</i> with few dissentient voices, and with no greater
violation of established custom than the distributing three different
performers, Mr. Connor, Mr. Yates, and Mrs. Davenport, in the
pit and boxes, to hold a dialogue with a person on the stage, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>the introductory interlude of The Manager in Distress at Covent
Garden. We, however, do not object to this novelty, if nobody
else does, and if it is not repeated; and it certainly did not put us
in an ill humour for seeing Mr. Jones’s ‘Too Late for Dinner.’
Mr. Jones is much such an author as he is an actor—wild, but
agreeable, going all lengths without making much progress, determined
to please, and succeeding by dint of noise, bustle, whim, and
nonsense. There is neither much plot, nor much point in the new
farce; but it tells, and keeps the house laughing by a sort of absurd
extravagance and good humour. Besides, Mr. Jones plays in it
himself, and exerts himself with his wonted alacrity; so do Mr.
Liston, Mr. Emery, Mrs. Davenport, and Miss Foote. The author
has, indeed, cut out a cockney character for Liston (who is the
<i>Magnus Apollo</i> of farce writers), as good as our old friend Lubin
Log; and the scene in which he comes in stuffing buns, and talking
at the same time, till he nearly chokes himself in the double operation,
is one that would do for Hogarth to paint, if he were alive; or, as
he is not, for Mr. Wilkie. Emery is a country bumpkin, who is
learning French, to fit himself for travel into foreign parts; and his
Yorkshire dialect and foreign jargon, jumbled together, have a very
odd effect. But Mr. Emery’s acting, we are sorry to say, is not a
subject for criticism: it is always just what it ought to be; and it is
impossible to praise it sufficiently, because there is never any opportunity
for finding fault with it. To criticise him, would be like
criticising the countryman, who carried the pig under his cloak. He
is always the very character he undertakes to represent; we mean, in
his favourite and general cast of acting.</p>

<div class='c031'>[<i>May, 1820.</i></div>

<p class='c021'>We don’t know where to begin this article—whether with Mr.
Matthews and his Country Cousins; or with Harlequin <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i>
Shakespear; or Cinderella and the Little Glass Slipper; or the
story of Goody Two-Shoes and the Fate of Calas, at the Summer
Theatre of Sadler’s Wells; or with Mr. Booth’s Lear, which we
have seen with great pleasure; or with Mr. Kean’s, which is a greater
pleasure to come, (so we anticipate) and which we see is put off to
the last moment, lest, we suppose, as the play-bills announce, ‘the
immortal Shakespear should meet with opponents.’ And why should
the immortal Shakespear meet with opponents in this case? Nobody
can tell. But to prevent so terrible and unlooked-for a catastrophe,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>and to protect the property of the theatre at so alarming a crisis from
cries of ‘fire’ the Manager has thought it his duty ‘to suspend the
Free List during the representation, the public press excepted.’ As
we have not the mortification of the exclusion, nor the benefit of the
exception, we care little about the matter, but as a curiosity in
theatrical diplomacy. The anxiety of the Manager about the double
trust committed to him, the property of a great theatre, and the fame
of a great poet, is exemplary; and the precautions he uses for their
preservation, no less admirable and efficacious:—so that, if the tragedy
of King Lear should pass muster for a night or two, without suffering
the greatest indignities, it will be owing to the <i>suspension of the Free
List</i>: if Mr. Kean should ride triumphant in a sea of passion, the
king of sorrows, and drown his audience in a flood of tears, it will
be owing to the <i>suspension of the Free List</i>: if the heart-rending
tragedy of the immortal bard, as it was originally written, does not
meet with the same untoward fate as the speaking pantomime of the
late Mr. Garrick deceased, ‘altered by a professional gentleman of
great abilities,’ it will be owing to the <i>suspension of the Free List</i>. In
a word, if the glory of the ‘great heir of fame’ does not totter to its
base at the representation of his noblest work, nor the property of the
theatre tumble about our ears the very first night, we shall have to
thank Mr. Elliston’s timely care in the <i>suspension of the Free List</i>!
‘Strange that an old poet’s memory should be as mortal as a new
manager’s wits!’ This bold anticipation and defiance of opposition,
where none can be expected, is not very politic, though it may be
very valiant. It is bringing into litigation an unencumbered estate
(we mean that part of it relating to the character of Shakspear) of
which we are in full and quiet possession. It is not only waking the
sleeping lion, but kicking him. Mr. Elliston’s shutting his doors in
the face of the Free List is like Don Quixote’s throwing open the
cages of the wild beasts in the caravan, and insisting that they should
come out and fight him. If the Free List were that formidable and
ill-disposed body of sworn foes to Shakspear, that ‘tasteless monster
that the world ne’er saw,’ and into which the manager’s officious
zeal for the interests of the theatre would convert them, it were best
to let them alone, and not court their hostility by invidious and
impracticable disqualifications. If they are determined to <i>damn</i>
Shakspear, there is no help for it: if they hold no such antipathy
to him, ‘if that they love the gentle bard,’ why should their
‘unhoused, free condition, be put in circumscription and confine,’
during the Manager’s pleasure? We are in no great pain for the
deathless renown of Shakspear: but we really entertain apprehensions
that these Berlin and Milan decrees (in imitation of a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>man) which our arbitrary theatrical dictator is in the habit of issuing
at the bottom of his play-bills, may be of no service to the life-renters
of Drury-lane. We hear a report (which we do not believe, and
shall be happy to contradict) that the Drury-Lane Management have
put in a claim to the exclusive representation of Lear, and have proposed
to suspend the performance at the other house. This we think
too much, even for the gratuitous and imposing pretensions of Mr.
Elliston. We shall, at this rate, soon see stuck up about the town,—‘Shakspear
performed at this theatre, for a few nights only, by
permission of the Manager of Drury-Lane!’ Why, this would be a
sweeping clause indeed, a master-stroke at the liberty of the stage.
It cannot be. It is ‘as if he would confine the interminable.’ He
may seat himself in the manager’s chair, like the lady in the lobster,
but the tide of Shakspear’s genius must be allowed to take its full
scope, and overflow, like the Nile, the banks on either side of Russell
Street. Our poet is national, not private property. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quondam</span></i>
proprietor of the Circus cannot catch this mighty Proteus to make
a Harlequin of him: it is not in the bond, that he should not
now let any one else but Mr. Kean play Shakspear, as he once
objected to let it play at all! We suspect this idle report
must have arisen, not from any hint of an injunction, on the
part of Mr. Elliston, against ‘a beard so old and white’ as Mr.
Booth’s; but as a critical reproof to the Covent-Garden Managers,
for reviving Nahum Tate’s Lear, instead of the original text; and
as a friendly suggestion to them instantly to deprive Cordelia of
her lover—and to exclude the Free List ‘<i>lest the immortal Shakspear
should meet with opponents!</i>’ But we have said enough on this
ridiculous subject.</p>

<p class='c021'>We proceed to another; Mr. Matthews’s Country Cousins. This
is the third season that this gentleman has entertained the town successfully,
and we trust profitably to himself, by a <i>melange</i> of imitations,
songs, narrative, and ventriloquism, entirely of his own getting
up. For one man to be able to amuse the public, or, as the phrase
is, to <i>draw houses</i>, night after night, by a display of his own resources
and feats of comic dexterity alone, shews great variety and piquancy
of talent. The Country Cousins is popular, like the rest: the
audiences are, at this present speaking, somewhat thinner, but they
do not laugh the less. We do not regret that Mr. Matthews has
been transferred from the common stage to a stage of his own. He
himself complained, at first, (as the cause of this removal) that he
had not regular opportunities afforded him at Covent Garden for
appearing in legitimate comedy, which was the chief object of his
study and his ambition. If it were not the most ridiculous of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>things to expect self-knowledge from any man, this ground of complaint
would be sufficiently curious. Mr. Matthews was seldom or
never put into any characters but those of mimicry and burlesque by
the managers of Covent Garden: into what characters has he put
himself since he has been upon his own hands? why, seldom or never
into any but those of mimicry and burlesque. We remember on
some former occasion throwing out a friendly discouragement of
Mr. Matthews’s undertaking the part of Rover in Wild Oats, (as
not exactly fitted to his peculiar cast of acting) which we had
reason to think was not received in good part: yet how did he himself
propose to make it palatable, and how did he really contrive to
make it tolerable, to the audience?—By the introduction of Imitations
of all the actors on the London boards. It is not easy to give
a character of a man (without making a fool of him) with which he
shall be satisfied: but actors are in general so infatuated with applause,
or sore from disappointment, that they are, of all men, the least
accessible to reason. We critics are a sort of people whom they very
strangely look upon as in a state of natural hostility with them. A
person who undertakes to give an account of the acted drama in
London, may be supposed to be led to this by some fondness for, and
some knowledge of, the stage: here then ‘there’s sympathy’ between
the actor and the critic. He praises the good, he holds out a warning
to the bad. The last may have cause to complain, but the first do
not thank you a bit the more. You cheer them in the path of glory,
shew them where to pluck fresh laurels, or teach them to shun the
precipice, on which their hopes may be dashed to pieces: you devote
your time and attention to them; are romantic, gay, witty, profound
in adorning their art with every embellishment you have in store to
make it interesting to others; you occupy the eyes and ears of the
town with their names and affairs; weigh their merits and defects in
daily, weekly, monthly scales, with as much preparation and formality
as if the fate of the world depended on their failure or success; and
yet they seem to suppose that your whole business and only object
are to degrade and vilify them in public estimation. What you say
in praise of any individual, is set down to the score of his merit:
what you say of others, in common justice to yourself, is considered
as a mere effusion of spleen, stupidity, and spite—as if you took a
particular pleasure in torturing their feelings. Yet, upon second
thoughts, there may be some ground for all this. We do not like to
have a physician feel our pulse, shake his head, and prescribe a
regimen: many persons have objection to sit for their pictures, and
there is, perhaps, something in the very fact of being criticised, to
which human nature is not easily reconciled. To have every word
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>you speak scanned, every look scrutinised,—never to be sure whether
you are right or wrong; to have it said that this was too high, that
too low; to be abused by one person for the very same thing that
another ‘applauds you to the very echo, that does applaud again;’ to
have it hinted that one’s very best effort only just wanted something
to make it perfect; and that certain other parts which we thought
tolerable, were not to be endured; to be taken in pieces in this
manner, turned inside out, to be had up at a self-elected tribunal of
impertinence,—tried, condemned, and acquitted every night,—to
hear the solemn defence, the ridiculous accusation,—to be subjected
to a living anatomy,—to be made the text of a perpetual running
commentary,—to be set up in an antithesis, to be played upon in an
alliteration,—to have one’s faults separated from one’s virtues, like
the sheep from the goats by the good shepherd,—to be shorn bare
and have a mark set upon one,—to be bewitched and bedevilled by
the critics,—to lie at the mercy of every puny whipster, and not be
suffered to know whether one stands on one’s head or one’s heels till
he tells one how—has, to be sure, something very perplexing and
very provoking in it; and it is not so much to be wondered at that
the subjects of this kind of critical handling undergo the operation
with so little patience as they do. They particularly hate those
writers who pretend to patronize them, for this takes away even the
privilege of resentment.</p>

<p class='c021'>An actor, again, is seldom satisfied with being extolled for what
he is, unless you admire him for being what he is not. A great
tragic actress thinks herself particularly happy in comedy, and it is a
sort of misprision of treason not to say so. Your pen may grow
wanton in praise of the broad farcical humour of a low comedian;
but if you do not cry him up for the fine gentleman, he threatens to
leave the stage. Most of our best comic performers came out in
tragedy as their favourite line; and Mr. Matthews does not think it
enough to enliven a whole theatre with his powers of drollery, and
whim, and personal transformation, unless by way of preface and
apology he first delivers an epitaph on those talents for the legitimate
drama which were so prematurely buried at Covent Garden Theatre!—If
we were to speak our minds, we should say, that Mr. Matthews
shines particularly, neither as an actor, nor a mimic of actors, but
that his forte is a certain general tact, and versatility of comic power.
You would say, he is a clever performer: you would guess he is a
cleverer man. His talents are not pure, but mixed. He is best
when he is his own prompter, manager, and performer, orchestra,
and scene-shifter; and, perhaps, to make the thing complete, the
audience should be of his own providing too.—If we had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>known any thing more of Mr. Matthews than the account we have
heard of his imitating the interior of a German family, the wife lying
a-bed grumbling at her husband’s staying out, the husband’s return
home drunk, and the little child’s <i>padding</i> across the room to get to
its own bed as soon as it hears him, we should set him down for a
man of genius. These felicitous strokes are, however, casual and
intermittent in him:—they proceed from him rather by chance than
design, and are followed up by others equally gross and superficial.
Mr. Matthews wants taste, or has been spoiled by the taste of the
town, whom ‘he must live to please, and please to live.’ His talent,
though limited, is of a lively and vigorous fibre; capable of a succession
of shifts and disguises; he is <i>up to</i> a number of good things—single
hits here and there; but by the suddenness and abruptness of
his turns, he surprises and shocks oftener than he satisfies. His wit
does not move the muscles of the mind, but, like some practical joker,
gives one a good rap on the knuckles, or a lively box on the ear.
He serves up a <i>pic-nic</i> entertainment of scraps and odd ends (some of
them, we must say, old ones). He is like a host, who will not let
us swallow a mouthful, but offers us something else, and directly after
brings us the same dish again. He is in a continual hurry and disquietude
to please, and destroys half the effect by trying to increase
it. He is afraid to trust for a moment to the language of nature and
character, and wants to translate it into pantomime and grimace, like
a writing-master, who for the letter <i>I</i> has the hieroglyphic of an eye
staring you in the face. Mr. Matthews may be said to have taken
tythe of half the talents of the stage and of the town; yet his variety
is not always charming. There is something dry and meagre in his
jokes: they do not lard the lean earth as he walks; but seem as if
they might be written upon parchment. His humour, in short, is not
like digging into a fine Stilton cheese, but is more like the scrapings
of Shapsugar.—As an actor, we think he cannot rise higher than a
waiter, (certainly not a dumb one,) or than Mr. Wiggins. In this
last character, in particular, by a certain panic-struck expression of
countenance at the persecution of which the hen-pecked husband is
the victim, and by the huge unwieldy helplessness of his person,
unable to escape from it and from the rabble of boys at his heels, he
excites shouts of laughter, and hits off the humour of the thing to an
exact perfection. In general, his performance is of that kind which
implies manual dexterity, or an assumption of bodily defect, rather
than mental capacity: take from Mr. Matthews’s drollest parts an
odd shuffle in the gait, a restless volubility of speech and motion, a
sudden suppression of features, or the continual repetition of some
cant phrase with unabated vigour, and you reduce him to almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>total insignificance, and a state of still life. He is not therefore
like—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘A clock that wants both hands,</div>
      <div class='line'>As useless when it goes as when it stands:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>for only keep him going, and he bustles about the stage to some purpose.
As a mimic of other actors, Mr. Matthews fails as often as
he succeeds (we call it a failure, when it is with difficulty we can
distinguish the person intended,) and when he succeeds, it is more
by seizing upon some peculiarity, or exaggerating some defect, than
by hitting upon the true character or prominent features. He gabbles
like Incledon, or croaks like Suett, or lisps like Young; but when
he attempts the expressive silver-tongued cadences of John Kemble,
it is the shadow of a shade. If we did not know the contrary, we
should suppose he had never heard the original, but was imitating
some one who had. His best imitations are taken from something
characteristic or absurd that has struck his fancy, or occurred to his
observation in real life—such as a chattering footman, a drunken
coachman, a surly traveller, or a garrulous old Scotchwoman. This
last we would fix upon as Mr. Matthews’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span></i>. It was a
portrait of common nature, equal to Wilkie or Teniers—as faithful,
as simple, as delicately humorous, and with a slight dash of pathos;
but without one particle of caricature, of vulgarity, or ill-nature. We
see no reason why the ingenious artist should not show his Country
Cousins a gallery of such portraits, and of no others, once a year.
‘He might exhibit it every night for a month, and we should go to
see it every night!’<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c015'><sup>[44]</sup></a> What has impressed itself on our memory as
the next best thing to this exquisite piece of genuine painting, was
the broad joke of the abrupt proposal of a mutton-chop to the man
who is sea-sick, and the convulsive marks of abhorrence with which
it is received. The representation also of the tavern-beau in the
Country Cousins, who is about to swallow a lighted-candle for a glass
of brandy and water, as he is going drunk to bed, is well feigned and
admirably humoured; with many more, too long to mention. It is
more to our performer’s credit to suppose that the songs which he
sings with such rapidity and vivacity of effect are not of his own
composing; and, as to his ventriloquism, it is yet in its infancy. The
fault of these exhibitions—that which appears ‘first, midst, and last’
in them, is that they turn too much upon caricaturing the most
common-place and worn-out topics of ridicule—the blunders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>Frenchmen in speaking English,—the mispronunciations of the
cockney dialect, the ignorance of Country Cousins, and the impertinence
and foppery of relations in town. It would seem too likely
from the uniform texture of these pieces, that Mr. Matthews had
passed his whole time in climbing to the top of the Monument, or
had never been out of a tavern, or a stage-coach, a Margate-hoy or a
Dover packet-boat. We do not deny the merit of some of the cross-readings
out of the two languages; but certainly we think the quantity
of French and English jargon put into the mouths of French and
English travellers all through these imitations, must lessen their
popularity instead of increasing it, as two-thirds of Mr. Matthews’s
auditors, we should imagine, cannot know the point on which the
jest turns. We grant that John Bull is always very willing to laugh
at Mounseer, if he knew why or how—perhaps, even without knowing
how or why! But we thought many of the jokes of this kind,
however well contrived or intended, miscarried in their passage
through the pit, and long before they reached the two shilling gallery.</p>

<p class='c021'>A new pantomime, called <i>Shakspear versus Harlequin</i>, has been
produced at Drury-lane Theatre. It is called ‘a speaking pantomime:’
we had rather it had said nothing. It is better to act folly
than to talk it. The heels and wand and motley coat of Harlequin
are sacred to nonsense; but the words, the cap and wings of Mercury
(who was here also made the representative of Shakspear) are worthy
of a better use. The essence of pantomime is practical absurdity,
keeping the wits in constant chase, coming upon one by surprise, and
starting off again before you can arrest the fleeting phantom: the
essence of this piece was prosing stupidity remaining like a mawkish
fixture on the stage, and overcoming your impatience by the force of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>. A speaking pantomime (such as this one) is not unlike a
flying waggon: but we do not want a pantomime to move in minuet-time,
nor to have Harlequin’s light wand changed into a leaden mace.
If we must have a series of shocks and surprises, of violations of probability,
common sense, and nature, to keep the brain and senses in a
whirl, let us, at least, have them hot and hot, let them ‘charge on
heaps, that we may lose distinction in <i>absurdity</i>,’ and not have time
to doze and yawn over them, in the intervals of the battle. The
bringing Harlequin to the test of reason resembles the old story of
hedging in the cuckoo, and surpasses the united genius of the late
Mr. Garrick (to whom this dull farce is ascribed) and of the professional
gentleman who has fitted the above productions of ‘the
olden times’ (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> those of the late Mr. Garrick) to modern taste!
After all, though Harlequin is tried by three grave judges, who are
very unnecessarily metamorphosed into three old women, no competition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>no collision takes place between him and the genius of Shakspear,
unless Mr. T. Cooke’s playing very cleverly on a variety of musical
instruments, so as to ravish the heart of Miss Dolly Snip (Madam
Vestris) can be construed into so many proofs of the superiority of
Shakspear’s Muse! Again, Mr. Harley, as Harlequin, and Mr.
Oxberry (as a country clown) get up into a tree to see the sport,
from which it was as difficult to dislodge them as owls from an ivy-bush;
and the sport is to see Joey Snip, the tailor, have his head cut
off, and walk with it about the stage, and, unlike the sign of the
good woman, talk without his tongue. The slicing off a blackamoor’s
head or two with the stroke of a scymitar, provided the thing is done
quickly, and instantly got out of sight, we do not much object to;
but we do not like to have a ghastly spectre of this sort placed before
us for a whole evening, as the heads of the rebel Scotch lords were
stuck on Temple-bar for half a century. It may be well said indeed,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod sic mihi ostendis incredulus odi</span></i>. Perhaps this exhibition of
posthumous horror and impertinence might be meant as a sly hit at
the ghost of Hamlet.</p>

<p class='c022'>If so, we cry the Manager mercy. We must add, that the strength
of the theatre was put in requisition for this piece, and if it could
have been saved, it would. Miss Tree, to enliven so many dreary
objects, danced a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</span></i>. We would rather see this young lady
dance round a may-pole at a country wake or fair.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>We could not help repeating these lines as we saw the youngest of
the Miss Dennetts, the tallest of the three, resume the part of
Cinderella at Covent Garden,—restored, like Psyche, to her late-lost
home, and transformed by the little hump-backed fairy, from a poor
house-maid to a bright princess, drinking pleasure and treading air.
This is a consummation more devoutly to be wished than the
changing of a pipkin into a sign-post, or a wheel-barrow into a china-shop.
A Fairy Tale is the true history of the human heart—it is a
dream of youth realized! How many country-girls have fancied
themselves princesses, nay, what country-girl ever was there that,
some time or other, did not? A Fairy Tale is what the world
would be, if every one had their wishes or their desserts, if our power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>and our passions were equal. We cannot be at a loss for a thousand
bad translations of the story of Cinderella, if we look around us in
the boxes. But the real imitation is on the stage. If we could
always see the flowers open in the spring, or hear soft music, or see
Cinderella dance, or dream we did, life itself would be a Fairy Tale.
If the three Miss Dennetts are a little less like one another than they
were, on the other hand, we must say that Miss Eliza Dennett (what
a pretty name) is much improved, combines a little cluster of graces
in her own person, and ‘in herself sums all delight.’ She has learned
to add precision to ease, and firmness of movement to the utmost
harmony of form. In the scene where Cinderella is introduced at
court and is led out to dance by the enamoured prince, she bows as
if she had a diadem on her head, moves as if she had just burst from
fetters of roses, folds her arms as the vine curls its tendrils, and
hurries from the scene, after the loss of her faithless slipper, as if she
had to run a race with the winds. We had only one thing to desire,
that she and her lover, instead of the new ballet, had danced the
Minuet de la Cour with the Gavot, as they do in the Dansomanie;
that we might have called the Minuet de la Cour divine, and the
Gavot heavenly, and exclaimed once more, with more than artificial
rapture—‘Such were the joys of our dancing days!’ We do not
despair of seeing this alteration adopted, as our recommendations are
sometimes attended to: and in that case we shall feel.—But the
mechanical anticipation of an involuntary burst of sentiment in supposed
circumstances is in vile taste, and we leave it to lords and
pettifoggers. We hate to copy them: but we like to steal from
Spenser. Here is a passage descriptive of dancing, and of the delights
of love, of youth, and beauty which sometimes surround it, and of the
eternal echo which they leave in the ear of fancy. The Managers
of Covent-Garden may perhaps apply it to their own enchanted
palace: we have nothing to do with the passage but to quote it.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>On the subject of the pantomime and the miscellaneous Drama,
we have two words to add, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i> that we have been to see the Heart
of Midlothian at the Surrey Theatre, of which we spoke by hearsay
in our last but one, and which answered our warmest expectations;
and that we took a pleasant stroll up to the Aquatic Theatre of
Sadler’s Wells, and after dining at the Sir Hugh Middleton’s Head,
saw a very pretty play-house, Goody Two Shoes, the Monastery,
and the Fate of Calas. Goody Two Shoes was played first, on the
evening we were there, because Mr. Grimaldi and Mr. Barnes were
in it, and they were obliged afterwards to perform in the pantomime
at Covent Garden. Did Miss Vallancy go with them? Otherwise,
we should like to have seen her again in the course of the evening.
All that we could see to praise in the Monastery was its faithfulness
to the original, and the acting of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley. We hope
that under the management of a gentleman (Mr. Howard Paine,) so
well acquainted with both departments of his undertaking, the literary
and dramatic, this theatre will soon flourish in all the pride of summer.
We had nearly omitted to notice a new Hamlet, that came out at
Drury-lane a few weeks ago, who, it appeared to us, would have
made the prettiest Hamlet we have seen, if he had been only equal to
the part. Indeed he looked it to perfection; he had an elegant
figure with a thoughtful face; and on the ordinary conduct and
conception of the character, was at once the gentleman and scholar.
In the more declamatory and impassioned scenes, however, his voice
totally broke down under him, and he did not repeat the part as was
given out; for he was the next morning pierced through with the
feathered arrows of criticism, as if his breast had been a target. The
gentlemen-critics of the daily press have not, in general, their cue on
the first night of a performer’s appearance. If he fails, they fall upon
him without mercy; if he succeeds, they are almost afraid to say so, lest
others should say that they were wrong. They pretend (some of
them) to lead public opinion and yet have no opinion of their own.
They dare not boldly and distinctly declare their opinion of a new
dramatic experiment, and the reason is, their convictions are not clear
enough to warrant their placing any confidence in them, till they are
confirmed by being put to the vote. The first quality of a good
critic is courage; but mental courage, like bodily, is the result of
conscious strength. Some of the Vampyre crew, indeed, retreat
from the dimness and inanity of their perceptions, into the solid
darkness of their prejudices, and the crude consistence of their everrankling
spite; and, in that strong-hold of dirt and cob-webs, are
impervious to every ray of sense or reason. We might leave them, if
they had themselves been contented to remain, in their narrow, gloomy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>cells, the proper hiding-place of ignorance and bigotry; but when
they come out into the blaze of noon,</p>

      <div class='line'>And hooting at the glorious sun in heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>Cry out, where is it?’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>it is time to stop their ominous flight, and send them back to that life
of sloth and pride, where the poison of dull-eyed envy preys only
upon itself.</p>

<p class='c021'>There was a want of proper spirit and gallantry shown the other
day in the critical reception of Mr. Booth’s Lear. It was not
thought that he would make any thing of it, and therefore it was not
said that he did. Because he was on his trial, he was not to have a
hearing. Because he was <i>not</i> ‘the most favoured actor of the day,’
he was to have no favour at all shown him. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fiat justitia, ruat cælum.</span></i>
When Mr. Booth does nothing but make wry faces and odd harsh
noises in a character, in imitation of Mr. Kean, we will say, that he
does it ill: but when he plays it as he did Lear, we will say that he
does it not ill, but well, and that in prejudging him, we have been
mistaken. It does not lessen Mr. Macready in our opinion, that (as
we understand) he refused this character in obstinate despair of doing it
justice: but if this was a proof of modesty and judgment in him, it
certainly ought to raise our idea of Mr. Booth’s talents, that he was
able to get through it in the way he did. Where failure would have
been so fatal and so marked, it was a sufficient triumph even to a
proud ambition not to fail. If the part in our adventurous actor’s
hands wanted something of the breadth and majesty of Lear, it did
not want for life or spirit, or a human interest. If he did not give
the torrent and whirlwind of the passion, he had plenty of its gusts
and flaws. Without his crown, or even the faded image of one,
circling his brow, he bustled about the stage with a restlessness and
impetuosity of feeling that kept expectation continually awake and
gratified the attention which had been so excited. There was no
feebleness, and no vulgarity in any part of Mr. Booth’s acting, but it
was animated, vigorous, and pathetic throughout. The audience, we
are sure, the first night, thought and felt as we did. In the exclamation,
‘I am every inch a king,’ his energy rose to dignity: again,
in his reiteration of Gloucester’s epithet of ‘the <i>fiery</i> Duke,’ applied
to his son-in-law, his manifest impatience, and increasing irritability,
showed that Mr. Booth had felt the full force of that beautiful
passage in which his own half-conscious infirmity is played off so
finely on the ill-fated old king; and in the scenes with Edgar as mad
Tom, where his wits begin to unsettle, the distraction and alienation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>of his mind, wandering from its own thoughts to catch hold of a clue
less painful, and yet broken and entangled like them, were pourtrayed
with equal skill and delicacy. In the more set speeches, as in the
curse on his daughters, Mr. Booth, we thought, comparatively failed;
but where action was to come in aid of the sentiment and point the
meaning, he was almost uniformly correct and impressive. In fact,
it is only when the poet’s language is explained by the comment of
gesture or some sudden change of look, or situation—that is, when
tragedy is enlivened by pantomime, that it becomes intelligible to the
greater part of the audience; and we do not see how an actor can be
supposed to do those things well which are almost abstractions in his
art, and in which he is not encouraged by the sympathy or corrected
by the judgment of his hearers. We observed, that the finest touches
of thought, of poetry and nature in this play, which were not set off
by the accompaniment of show and bustle, passed in profound silence,
and without the smallest notice. The sublimity of repose is one in
which our play-house frequenters do not seem to be proficients, and
the players may be excused, if they do not always cultivate (as we
might wish) this occult and mysterious branch of their profession.
Of Mr. C. Kemble’s Edgar we cannot speak in terms of too high
praise. In the supposed mad-scenes, his conception and delivery of
the part excited the warmest approbation; his fine face and figure
admirably relieved the horror of the situations; and, whenever we see
Mad Tom played (which is not often), we should wish to see it
played by him. The rest of the play was very respectably got up,
and all we could object to was the interspersion of the love-scenes by
Tate. The happy ending, and the triumph and dotage of the poor
old king in repeating again and again, ‘Cordelia’s Queen, Cordelia’s
Queen,’ were perhaps allowable concessions to the feelings of the
audience.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Henri Quatre.</span>—There are two lines in a modern poem which we
often repeat to ourselves—</p>

      <div class='line'>That like a trumpet made young spirits dance:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>and we were much disposed to apply them to this romantic, light and
elegant drama. We prophesy that the Managers and the public have
a splendid career before them for the season. <i>This will do.</i> We
saw it in the first opening scene, a view near Paris, the clearest, the
most sparkling, the most vivid we ever saw. ‘Ah! brilliant land!
ah! sunny, cloudless skies! Not all the ink, that has been shed to
blacken thee, can blot thy shining face! Not all the blood that has
been spilt to enslave thee can choke up thy living breath!’ If we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>can thus be transported to another and a gayer region, and made to
drink the warmth and lustre of another climate by the painter’s magic
art, what can we desire more?—What the pencil had in this case done,
the poet’s pen did not undo: what the author had written, the actors
did not spoil. They <i>do</i> order these things well at Covent Garden.
We never saw a piece better got up in all its parts, nor one more
adapted to the taste of the town in scenery, in dresses, in songs, in
passing allusions, in popular sentiments; nor one that went off with
less <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i>, or with more continual bursts of flattering applause. The
writing (as far as it was French) was, as might be expected, lively and
sentimental: as far as we could perceive Mr. Morton to have had a
hand in it, it consisted of strong touches of obvious nature, and showed
a perfect understanding with the actors and the audience. The
characters were strikingly conceived, and admirably sustained. Mr.
Macready’s Henri Quatre was (we think) his very happiest effort.
There was an originality, a raciness in it that hit our palates. With
something, nay, with much of the stiffness and abruptness of one of
‘the invincible knights of old,’ used to march in rusty armour, there
was at the same time the ease, the grace and gallantry of an
accomplished courtier. ‘He is ten times handsomer,’ says the fair
Jocrisse, ‘than Uncle Jervais,’ and according to her husband’s
comment, ‘Handsome is that handsome does.’ There was a spirit of
kindness blended with authority in his tones and in his actions; he
was humane, and yet a king and a soldier. Some of the sentiments
put into his mouth were worthy of the attention of princes, if they had
time for serious reflection, and called forth loud and repeated plaudits.
Henry professed his desire to reign by love not fear in the hearts of
his subjects; and quoted a saying of his mother’s on the mode of
effecting this purpose, that ‘a pound of honey would draw more flies
than a ton of vinegar.’ We seemed suddenly and unaccountably
carried back to the heroic times of camps and courts, in the company
of this good-natured, high spirited, old fashioned monarch, and his
favourite counsellor, Sully, a pattern of sound thinking and plain-speaking,
who was characteristically represented by Mr. Egerton. It is his
business to prevent the king from doing anything wrong,—‘no
sinecure,’ as he honestly declares. We like these bitter jests; and
we found that others were of our thinking, though they flew about as
thick as hail. We should have thought this piece more likely to have
been imported from Spain than France, at the present crisis of affairs.
At any rate, Mr. Morton has given a truly English version of it.
Mr. Emery played a blunt, rough old soldier (Moustache,) well, who
is afterwards appointed keeper of a prison—‘Because,’ he says to
his sovereign, ‘you think me a savage.’ ‘No!’ (is the answer,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>‘but because with the courage and rough outside of a lion you have
the heart of a man.’ The scenes in which Charles Kemble, as
Eugene de Biron, is committed to his charge under sentence of death—is
liberated by him to perform a last act of friendship and of
affection, and returns on his parole of honour to meet his fate (from
which however he is delivered by having, in his night’s adventure,
saved the lives of Henri and Sully, who had been attacked by
assassins in a forest hard by) are among the most interesting of the
story. We do not enter into the details of the plot, because we hope
all our readers will go to see this piece, and it is anticipating a
pleasure to come. Besides, we are bad hands at getting up a plot,
and should on that account make but indifferent ministers of state.
But the whole was delightful. Miss M. Tree was delightful as the
village representative of the fair Gabrielle; Mr. Liston was happy as
the husband of Jocrisse, ‘whom the king had deigned to salute,’ and
to put a diamond ring on her finger, which was to introduce them to
the Louvre in their wooden shoes on his coronation day.—Miss
Stephens sung sweetly; Mr. Fawcett was at home in the old general;
Irish Johnstone blundered in his own beautiful <i>brogue</i>, and every thing
was as it should be. We like things to succeed in this manner: that
they do not always do so, is assuredly no fault of ours.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Mr. Kean’s Lear.</span>—We need not say how much our expectations
had been previously excited to see Mr. Kean in this character, and
we are sorry to be obliged to add, that they were very considerably
disappointed. We had hoped to witness something of the same effect
produced upon an audience that Garrick is reported to have done in
the part, which made Dr. Johnson resolve never to see him repeat it—the
impression was so terrific and overwhelming. If we should
make the same rash vow never to see Mr. Kean’s Lear again, it
would not be from the intensity and excess, but from the deficiency
and desultoriness of the interest excited. To give some idea of the
manner in which this character might, and ought to be, made to seize
upon the feelings of an audience, we have heard it mentioned, that
once, when Garrick was in the middle of the mad-scene, his crown of
straw came off, which circumstance, though it would have been fatal
to a common actor, did not produce the smallest interruption, or even
notice in the house. On another occasion, while he was kneeling to
repeat the curse, the first row in the pit stood up in order to see him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>better; the second row, not willing to lose the precious moments by
remonstrating, stood up too; and so, by a tacit movement, the entire
pit rose to hear the withering imprecation, while the whole passed in
such cautious silence, that you might have heard a pin drop. John
Kemble (that old campaigner) was also very great in the curse: so
we have heard, from very good authorities; and we put implicit faith
in them.—What led us to look for the greatest things from Mr.
Kean in the present instance, was his own opinion, on which we have
a strong reliance. It was always his favourite part. We have understood
he has been heard to say, that ‘he was very much obliged to
the London audiences for the good opinion they had hitherto expressed
of him, but that when they came to see him over the dead body of
Cordelia, they would have quite a different notion of the matter.’
As it happens, they have not yet had an opportunity of seeing him
over the dead body of Cordelia: for, after all, our versatile Manager
has acted Tate’s Lear instead of Shakspear’s: and it was suggested,
that perhaps Mr. Kean played the whole ill <i>out of spite</i>, as he could
not have it his own way—a hint to which we lent a willing ear,
for we would rather think Mr. Kean the most spiteful man, than not
the best actor, in the world! The impression, however, made on
our minds was, that, instead of its being his master-piece, he was to
seek in many parts of the character;—that the general conception was
often perverse, or feeble; and that there were only two or three
places where he could be said to electrify the house. It is altogether
inferior to his Othello. Yet, if he had even played it equal to that,
all we could have said of Mr. Kean would have been that he was a
very wonderful man;—and such we certainly think him as it is.
Into the bursts, and starts, and torrent of the passion in Othello, this
excellent actor appeared to have flung himself completely: there was
all the fitful fever of the blood, the jealous madness of the brain: his
heart seemed to bleed with anguish, while his tongue dropped broken,
imperfect accents of woe; but there is something (we don’t know how)
in the gigantic, outspread sorrows of Lear, that seems to elude his
grasp, and baffle his attempts at comprehension. The passion in
Othello pours along, so to speak, like a river, torments itself in restless
eddies, or is hurled from its dizzy height, like a sounding cataract.
That in Lear is more like a sea, swelling, chafing, raging, without
bound, without hope, without beacon, or anchor. Torn from the
hold of his affections and fixed purposes, he floats a mighty wreck in
the wide world of sorrows. Othello’s causes of complaint are more
distinct and pointed, and he has a desperate, a maddening remedy for
them in his revenge. But Lear’s injuries are without provocation,
and admit of no alleviation or atonement. They are strange, bewildering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>overwhelming: they wrench asunder, and stun the whole frame:
they ‘accumulate horrors on horror’s head,’ and yet leave the mind
impotent of resources, cut off, proscribed, anathematised from the
common hope of good to itself, or ill to others—amazed at its own
situation, but unable to avert it, scarce daring to look at, or to weep
over it. The action of the mind, however, under this load of
disabling circumstances, is brought out in the play in the most
masterly and triumphant manner: it staggers under them, but it does not
yield. The character is cemented of human strength and human
weaknesses (the firmer for the mixture):—abandoned of fortune, of
nature, of reason, and without any energy of purpose, or power of
action left,—with the grounds of all hope and comfort failing under it,—but
sustained, reared to a majestic height out of the yawning abyss,
by the force of the affections, the imagination, and the cords of the
human heart—it stands a proud monument, in the gap of nature, over
barbarous cruelty and filial ingratitude. We had thought that Mr.
Kean would take possession of this time-worn, venerable figure, ‘that
has outlasted a thousand storms, a thousand winters,’ and, like the
gods of old, when their oracles were about to speak, shake it with
present inspiration:—that he would set up a living copy of it on the
stage: but he failed, either from insurmountable difficulties, or from
his own sense of the magnitude of the undertaking. There are
pieces of ancient granite that turn the edge of any modern chisel: so
perhaps the genius of no living actor can be expected to cope with
Lear. Mr. Kean chipped off a bit of the character here and there:
but he did not pierce the solid substance, nor move the entire mass.—Indeed,
he did not go the right way about it. He was too violent at
first, and too tame afterwards. He sunk from unmixed rage to mere
dotage. Thus (to leave this general description, and come to
particulars) he made the well-known curse a piece of downright rant.
He ‘tore it to tatters, to very rags,’ and made it, from beginning to
end, an explosion of ungovernable physical rage, without solemnity, or
elevation. Here it is; and let the reader judge for himself whether
it should be so served.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Hear, Nature, hear; dear goddess, hear a father!</div>
      <div class='line'>Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend</div>
      <div class='line'>To make this creature fruitful:</div>
      <div class='line'>Into her womb convey sterility,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dry up in her the organs of increase,</div>
      <div class='line'>And from her derogate body never spring</div>
      <div class='line'>A babe to honour her! If she must teem,</div>
      <div class='line'>Create her child of spleen, that it may live,</div>
      <div class='line'>And be a thwart disnatur’d torment to her:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,</div>
      <div class='line'>With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;</div>
      <div class='line'>Turn all her mother’s pains and benefits</div>
      <div class='line'>To laughter and contempt; that she may feel,</div>
      <div class='line'>How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is</div>
      <div class='line'>To have a thankless child.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Now this should not certainly be spoken in a fit of drunken choler,
without any ‘compunctious visitings of nature,’ without any relentings
of tenderness, as if it was a mere speech of hate, directed against a
person to whom he had the most rooted and unalterable aversion.
The very bitterness of the imprecations is prompted by, and turns
upon, an allusion to the fondest recollections: it is an excess of indignation,
but that indignation, from the depth of its source, conjures up
the dearest images of love: it is from these that the brimming cup of
anguish overflows; and the voice, in going over them, should falter,
and be choked with other feelings besides anger. The curse in Lear
should not be <i>scolded</i>, but recited as a Hymn to the Penates! Lear
is not a Timon. From the action and attitude into which Mr. Kean
put himself to repeat this passage, we had augured a different result.
He threw himself on his knees; lifted up his arms like withered
stumps; threw his head quite back, and in that position, as if severed
from all that held him to society, breathed a heart-struck prayer, like
the figure of a man obtruncated!—It was the only moment worthy of
himself, and of the character.</p>

<p class='c021'>In the former part of the scene, where Lear, in answer to the cool
didactic reasoning of Gonerill, asks, ‘Are you our daughter?’ &amp;c.,
Mr. Kean, we thought, failed from a contrary defect. The suppression
of passion should not amount to immobility: that intensity of
feeling of which the slightest intimation is supposed to convey everything,
should not seem to convey nothing. There is a difference
between ordinary familiarity and the <i>sublime</i> of familiarity. The
mind may be staggered by a blow too great for it to bear, and may not
recover itself for a moment or two; but this state of suspense of its
faculties, ‘like a phantasma, or a hideous dream,’ should not assume
the appearance of indifference, or <i>still-life</i>. We do not think Mr.
Kean kept this distinction (though it is one in which he is often very
happy) sufficiently marked in the foregoing question to his daughter,
nor in the speech which follows immediately after, as a confirmation
of the same sentiment of incredulity and surprise.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Does any here know me? This is not Lear:</div>
      <div class='line'>Does Lear walk thus? speak thus? where are his eyes?</div>
      <div class='line'>Either his notion weakens, his discernings</div>
      <div class='line'>Are lethargied—Ha! waking—’tis not so;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>Who is it that can tell me who I am?</div>
      <div class='line'>Lear’s shadow? I would learn; for by the marks</div>
      <div class='line'>Of sovereignty, of knowledge, and of reason,</div>
      <div class='line'>I should be false persuaded I had daughters.</div>
      <div class='line'>Your name, fair gentlewoman?’—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>These fearful interrogatories, which stand ready to start away on the
brink of madness, should not certainly be asked like a common
question, nor a dry sarcasm. If Mr. Kean did not speak them so,
we beg his pardon.—In what comes after this, in the apostrophe to
Ingratitude, in the sudden call for his horses, in the defence of the
character of his train as ‘men of choice and rarest parts,’ and in the
recurrence to Cordelia’s ‘most small fault,’ there are plenty of stops
to play upon, all the varieties of agony, of anger and impatience, of
asserted dignity and tender regret—Mr. Kean struck but two notes
all through, the highest and the lowest.</p>

<p class='c021'>This scene of Lear with Gonerill, in the first act, is only to be
paralleled by the doubly terrific one between him and Regan and
Gonerill in the second act. To call it a decided failure would be
saying what we do not think: to call it a splendid success would be
saying so no less. Mr. Kean did not appear to us to set his back
fairly to his task, or to trust implicitly to his author, but to be trying
experiments upon the audience, and waiting to see the result. We
never saw this daring actor want confidence before, but he seemed to
cower and hesitate before the public eye in the present instance, and
to be looking out for the effect of what he did, while he was doing it.
In the ironical remonstrance to Regan, for example:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Dear daughter, I confess that I am old—</div>
      <div class='line'>Age is unnecessary, &amp;c.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>he might be said to be waiting for the report of the House to know
how low he should bend his knee in mimic reverence, how far he
should sink his voice into the tones of feebleness, despondency, and
mendicancy. But, if ever, it was upon <i>this</i> occasion that he ought to
have raised himself above criticism, and sat enthroned (in the towering
contemplations of his own mind) with Genius and Nature. They
alone (and not the critic’s eye, nor the tumultuous voices of the pit)
are the true judges of Lear! If he had trusted only to these, his
own counsellors and bosom friends, we see no limit to the effect he
might have produced. But he did not give any particular effect to
the exclamation—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in6'>——‘Beloved Regan,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy sister’s naught: oh, Regan, she hath tied</div>
      <div class='line'>Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture here:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>nor to the assurance that he will not return to her again—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Never, Regan:</div>
      <div class='line'>She hath abated me of half my train,</div>
      <div class='line'>Look’d black upon me; struck me with her tongue,</div>
      <div class='line'>Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>All the stored vengeances of heaven fall</div>
      <div class='line'>On her ingrateful top!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>nor to the description of his two daughters’ looks—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>——‘Her eyes are fierce; but thine</div>
      <div class='line'>Do comfort, and not burn:’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>nor to that last sublime appeal to the heavens on seeing Gonerill
approach—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, heav’ns!</div>
      <div class='line'>If you do love old men, if your sweet sway</div>
      <div class='line'>Hallow obedience, if yourselves are old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make it your cause, send down, and take my part.</div>
      <div class='line'>Art not asham’d to look upon this beard?</div>
      <div class='line'>Oh, Regan, will you take her by the hand?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>One would think there are tones, and looks, and gestures, answerable
to these words, to thrill and harrow up the thoughts, to ‘appal the
guilty, and make mad the free,’ or that might ‘create a soul under the
ribs of death!’ But we did not see, or hear them. It was Mr.
Kean’s business to furnish them: it would have been ours to feel
them, if he had! It is not enough that Lear’s crosses and perplexities
are expressed by single strokes. There should be an
agglomeration of horrors, closing him in like a phalanx. His speech
should be thick with the fulness of his agony. His face should, as it
were, encrust and stiffen into amazement at his multiplied afflictions.
A single image of ruin is nothing—there should be a growing desolation
all around him. His wrongs should seem enlarged tenfold
through the solid atmosphere of his despair—his thoughts should be
vast and lucid, like the sun when he declines—He should be ‘a huge
dumb heap’ of woe! The most that Mr. Kean did was to make some
single hits here and there; but these did not tell, because they were
separated from the main body and movement of the passion. They
might be compared to interlineations of the character, rather than
parts of the text. In the sudden reiteration of the epithet—‘<i>fiery</i>
quality of the Duke,’ applied to Cornwall by Gloucester, at which his
jealousy blazes out to extravagance, we thought Mr. Kean feeble and
indecisive: but in breaking away at the conclusion of the scene, ‘I
will do such things: what they are, yet I know not; but they shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>be the terrors of the earth,’—he made one of those tremendous bursts
of energy and grandeur, which shed a redeeming glory round every
character he plays.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Kean’s performance of the remainder of the character, when
the king’s intellects begin to fail him, and are, at last, quite disordered,
was curious and quaint, rather than impressive or natural. There
appeared a degree of perversity in all this—a determination to give
the passages in a way in which nobody else would give them, and in
which nobody else would expect them to be given. But singularity
is not always excellence. Why, for instance, should our actor lower
his voice in the soliloquy in the third act, ‘Blow winds, and crack
your cheeks,’ &amp;c. in which the tumult of Lear’s thoughts, and the
extravagance of his expressions, seem almost contending with the
violence of the storm? We can conceive no reason but that it was
contrary to the practice of most actors hitherto. Mr. Rae’s manner
of mouthing the passage would have been ‘more germane to the
matter.’ In asking his companion—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘How dost, my boy? Art cold?</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m cold myself’——</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>there was a shrinking of the frame, and a chill glance of the eye, like
the shivering of an ague-fit: but no other feeling surmounted the
physical expression. On meeting with Edgar, as Mad Tom, Lear
wildly exclaims, with infinite beauty and pathos, ‘Didst thou give all
to thy daughters, and art thou come to this?’ And again, presently
after, he repeats, ‘What, have his daughters brought him to this
pass? Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give ’em all?’—questions
which imply a strong possession, the eager indulgence of
a favourite idea which has just struck his heated fancy; but which
Mr. Kean pronounced in a feeble, sceptical, querulous under-tone, as
if wanting information as to some ordinary occasion of insignificant
distress. We do not admire these cross-readings of a work like
Lear. They may be very well when the actor’s ingenuity, however
paradoxical, is more amusing than the author’s sense: but it is not so
in this case. From some such miscalculation, or desire of finding out
a clue to the character, other than ‘was set down’ for him, Mr.
Kean did not display his usual resources and felicitous spirit in these
terrific scenes:—he drivelled, and looked vacant, and moved his lips,
so as not to be heard, and did nothing, and appeared, at times, as if
he would quite forget himself. The pauses were too long; the
indications of remote meaning were too significant to be well understood.
The spectator was big with expectation of seeing some
extraordinary means employed: but the general result did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>correspond to the waste of preparation. In a subsequent part, Mr.
Kean did not give to the reply of Lear, ‘Aye, every inch a king!’—the
same vehemence and emphasis that Mr. Booth did; and in this
he was justified: for, in the text, it is an exclamation of indignant
irony, not of conscious superiority; and he immediately adds with
deep disdain, to prove the nothingness of his pretensions—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Almost the only passage in which Mr. Kean obtained his usual heartfelt
tribute, was in his interview with Cordelia, after he awakes from
sleep, and has been restored to his senses.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Pray, do not mock me:</div>
      <div class='line'>I am a very foolish fond old man,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fourscore and upward; and to deal plainly,</div>
      <div class='line'>I fear, I am not in my perfect mind.</div>
      <div class='line'>Methinks, I should know you, and know this man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet I am doubtful; for I’m mainly ignorant</div>
      <div class='line'>What place this is; and all the skill I have</div>
      <div class='line'>Remembers not these garments; nay, I know not</div>
      <div class='line'>Where I did lodge last night. <i>Do not laugh at me,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>For, as I am a man, I think this lady</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>To be my child Cordelia.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Cordelia.</i> And so I am; I am.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>In uttering the last words, Mr. Kean staggered faintly into Cordelia’s
arms, and his sobs of tenderness, and his ecstasy of joy commingled,
drew streaming tears from the brightest eyes,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Which sacred pity had engender’d there.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Mr. Rae was very effective in the part of Edgar, and was received
with very great applause. If this gentleman could rein in a certain
‘false gallop’ in his voice and gait, he would be a most respectable
addition, from the spirit and impressiveness of his declamation, to the
general strength of any theatre, and we heartily congratulate him on
his return to Drury-lane.—Mrs. West made an interesting representative
of Cordelia. In all parts of plaintive tenderness, she is an
excellent actress. We could have spared the love-scenes—and one
of her lovers, Mr. Hamblin. Mr. Holland was great in Gloster.
In short, what is he not great in, that requires a great deal of sturdy
prosing, an ‘honest, sonsy, bawzont face,’ and a lamentably broken-down,
hale, wholesome, hearty voice, that seems ‘incapable of its
own distress?’ We like his jovial, well-meaning way of going about
his parts. We can afford, out of his good cheer, and lively aspect,
and his manner of bestriding the stage, to be made melancholy by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>him at any time, without being a bit the worse for it. Mr. Dowton’s
Kent was not at all good: it was a downright discarded serving-man.
Mr. Russel, in the absence of the Fool, played the zany in the
Steward. The tragedy was, in general, got up better than we
expected.</p>

<p class='c021'><cite>Artaxerxes.</cite>—We believe that this is the most beautiful opera in
the world, though we have great authorities against us: but we do
not believe, that it is better acted now than it ever was, though we
have no less an authority for us, were we disposed to be of that
opinion, than the Manager himself. The <i>Cognoscenti</i>, he tells us,
hold that this Musical Drama was never so got up before as it is at
present; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</span></i>, by Mr. Braham, Mr. Incledon, Miss Carew, and the
pretty little Madame Vestris. There is no degree of excellence,
however high, with which this Opera could be played, that we should
not hail with delight; and we would at any time go ten miles on foot,
only to see it played as we formerly did. The time we allude to, was
when Miss Stephens first came out in Mandane, when Miss Rennell
(who is since dead) played Artaxerxes, when Mr. Incledon played
the same part he does still, better than he does at present, when Miss
Carew was the fair Semira, who listens no less delightfully than she
sings, and some one (we forget who) played Arbaces, not very well.
As to Mr. Braham, he was not there, nor was he wanted;—for we
prefer the music of Arne, to Mr. Braham’s, and Mr. Braham willingly
gives us none but his own. He has omitted some of the most
exquisite airs in Artaxerxes to introduce others of his own composing;—and
where he has not done this, he might as well, for he so overloads,
embellishes, accompanies, and flourishes over the original songs
that one would hardly know them again. Can anything be more
tantalising than to hear him sing ‘Water parted from the sea?’
Instead of one continued stream of plaintive sound, labouring from
the heart with fond emotion, and still murmuring as it flows, it was
one incessant exhibition of frothy affectation and sparkling pretence;
as if the only ambition of the singer, and the only advantage he could
derive from the power and flexibility of his voice, was to run away
at every opportunity from the music and the sentiment. Does
Mr. Braham suppose that the finest pieces of composition were only
invented, and modulated into their faultless perfection, for him to
play tricks with, to make <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</span></i> experiments of his powers of
execution upon them, and to use the <i>score</i> of the musician only as the
rope-dancer does his rope, to vault up and down on,—to shew off his
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirouettes</span></i> and his summersaults, and to perform feats of impossibility?
This celebrated person’s favourite style of singing is like bad Opera-dancing,
of which not grace, but trick is the constant character. So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>Mr. Braham’s object is not to please but astonish his hearers—to do
what is difficult and absurd, not what is worth doing—to unfold the
richness, depth, sweetness, and variety of his tones, not to touch the
chords of sentiment. In fact, it is the essence of all perverted art,
to display art, and carry itself to the opposite extreme from nature,
lest it should be mistaken for her, instead of returning back to and
identifying itself as much as possible with nature (both as means and
end) that they may seem inseparable, and no one discern the difference.
The accomplished singer, whom we are criticising, too often
puts himself in the place of his subject. He mistakes the object of
the public. We do not go to the theatre to admire him, to hear him
<i>tune</i> his voice like an instrument for sale. We go to be delighted
with certain ‘concords of sweet sounds,’ which strike certain springs
in unison in the human breast. These things are found united in
nature, and in the works of the greatest masters, such as Arne and
Mozart. What they have joined together, why will Mr. Braham
put asunder? Why will he pour forth, for instance, as in this very
song which he murdered, a volume of sound in one note, like the
deep thunder, or the loud water-fall, and in the next, without any
change of circumstance, try to thrill the ear by an excess of the
softest and most voluptuous effeminacy? There is no reason why he
should—but that he <i>can</i>, and is allowed to do so. Mr. Braham, we
know, complains that the fault is not in his own taste, but in the
vitiated ear of the town which he is obliged (much against his will)
to pamper with trills, quavers, crotchets, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">falsettos</span></i>, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">bravuras</span></i>, and all
the idle brood of affectation and sickly sensibility. He might have
been taught a lesson to the contrary, a year or two ago, when he
sung with Miss Stephens at Covent-Garden; and never surely was
the difference of two styles more marked, or the triumph of good
taste over bad more complete. Mr. Braham could not plead want of
skill, of power, of practice: it was the difference of style only; and
Miss Stephens’s simple, artless manner, gave nothing but pure pleasure,
while Mr. Braham’s ornamental, laboured, complicated, or tortured
execution, excited feelings of mingled astonishment, regret, and
disappointment. There is Miss Tree again, who is another instance.
What is it that gives such a superiority to her singing? Nothing
but its truth, its seriousness, its sincerity. She has no capricios,
plays no fantastic tricks; but seems as much in the power, at the
mercy of the composer, as a musical instrument: her lips transmit
the notes she has by heart, as the Æolian harp is stirred by the
murmuring wind; and her voice seems to brood over, and become
enamoured of the sentiment. But simplicity, we believe, will not do
alone without sentiment, and we suspect Mr. Braham of a want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>sentiment. He apparently sings, as far as the passion is concerned,
from the marginal directions, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>con furio</i>, <i>con strepito</i>, <i>adagio</i></span>, etc., which
are but indifferent helps to expression; and where a performer cannot
fasten instinctively on the sympathy of his hearers, he has no better
resource than to make an appeal to their wonder. To confess the
extent of our insensibility, or our prejudice, we do not admire
Mr. Braham’s ‘Mild as the moonbeams,’ which is in his most lisping
and languishing, nor his ‘Wallace,’ which is in his most heroic
manner. What we like best, is his Oratorio style of singing, and that
is the most manly, the most direct, and the least an abuse of the
great powers which both Nature and Art have given to him. Having
said so much of Mr. Braham, we will say nothing of Mr. Incledon.
Miss Carew, as Mandane, warbled like a nightingale, and held her
head on one side like a peacock; of Madame Vestris, we repeat that
she is pretty. Indeed, we liked her the best of the four.</p>

<p class='c021'>The Drama is a subject of which we could give a very entertaining
account once a month, if there were no plays acted all the year.
But, as some artists have said of Nature, ‘the Theatres put us out.’
The only article we have written on this matter that has given us
entire satisfaction—(we answer, be it observed, for nobody but
ourselves)—is the one we wrote in the winter, when, in consequence
of two great public calamities, the theatres were closed for some
weeks together. We seized that lucky opportunity, to take a peep
into the raree-show of our own fancies,—the moods of our own minds,—and
a very pretty little kaleidoscope it made. Our readers, we
are sure, remember the description. Our head is stuffed full of
recollections on the subject of the Drama, some of older, some of
later date, but all treasured up with more or less fondness; we, in
short, love it, and what we love, we can talk of for ever. We love
it as well as Mr. Weathercock loves maccaroni; as Mr. Croker
loves the Quarterly Review, and the Quarterly Review the Edinburgh;
as Kings love Queens; and Scotchmen love their country. But, as
happens in some of these instances, we love it best at a distance.
We like to be a hundred miles off from the Acted Drama in London,
and to get a friend (who may be depended on) to give an account of
it for us; which we read, at our leisure, under the shade of a clump
of lime-trees. What is the use indeed of coming to town, merely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>discover that Mr. Elliston is ‘fat, fair, and forty,’ and becomes silk
hose worse than fleecy hosiery?</p>

<p class='c022'>We had rather stay where we are, and think how young, how
genteel, how sprightly Lewis was at seventy! Garrick too was
fat and pursy; but who ever perceived it through that airy soul of
his, that life of mind, that bore him up ‘like little wanton boys that
swim on bladders?’ Or why should we take coach to prevent our
friend and coadjutor, of the whimsical name,—that Bucolical Juvenile,
the Sir Piercie Shafton of the London Magazine,—from carrying off
his Mysie Happer, the bewitching Miss Brunton, from our critical
advances, and forestalling our praises of the grey twinkling eyes, the
large white teeth, and querulous catechising voice of this accomplished
little rustic? We shall leave him in full possession of his prize;—she
shall be his <i>Protection</i>, and he shall be her <i>Audacity</i>: but we
cannot consent to give up to his agreeable importunity our right and
interest in the Miss Dennetts—the fair, the ‘inexpressive three.’
We will not erase their names from our pages, but twine them in
cypher, as they are ‘written in our heart’s tables,’—though they do
not dance at the Opera! We have not this gentleman’s exquisitely
happy knack in the geography of criticism: nor do we carry a map
of London in our pockets to make out an exact scale of merit and
<i>virtu</i>; nor judge of black eyes, a white cheek, and so forth, by the
bills of mortality. We do not hate pathos because it is found in the
Borough; our taste (such as it is) can cross the water, by any of
the four bridges, in search of spirit and nature; we can make up our
minds to beauty even at Whitechapel! Our friend and correspondent,
Janus, grieves and wonders at this. He asks us why we do not
express his sentiments instead of our own? and we answer, ‘It is
because we are not you.’ He runs away from vulgar places and
people, as from the plague; swoons at the mention of the Royal
Cobourg; mimics his barber’s pronunciation of <i>Ashley’s</i>; and is
afraid to trust himself at Sadler’s Wells, lest his clothes should be
covered with gingerbread, and spoiled with the smell of gin and
tobacco. Now we, in our turn, laugh at all this. We are never
afraid of being confounded with the vulgar; nor is our time taken up
in thinking of what is ungenteel, and persuading ourselves that we
are mightily superior to it. The gentlemen in the gallery, in Fielding’s
time, thought every thing <i>low</i>; and our friend, Mr. Weathercock,
presents his compliments to us, and tells us we are wrong in condescending
to any thing beneath ‘Milanie’s foot of fire.’ We have
no notion of condescending in any thing we write about: we seek for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>truth and beauty wherever we can find them, and think that with
these we are safe from contamination. ‘Entire affection scorneth
nicer hands.’ Our comparative negligence, in this respect, probably
arises from the difference that exists between our dress and that of
our correspondent. A good judge has said, ‘a man’s mind is parcel
of his fortunes,’—and a man’s taste is part of his dress. If we wore
‘diamond rings on our fingers, antique cameos in our breast-pins,
cambric pocket-handkerchiefs breathing forth Attargul, and pale
lemon-coloured kid gloves,’ our perceptions might be strangely altered.
We might then think Mr. Young ‘the perfect gentleman both on
and off the stage,’ and consider Mr. Jones’s ‘cut-steel watch chain
quite refreshing.’ As it is, we differ from him on most of the above
points. Yet, for any thing we see to the contrary, we might safely
have staid in the country another month, and deputed the modern
Euphuist, as our tire-man of the theatre, to adjust Mr. Kemble’s
boots, to tie on Mr. Abbott’s sash to his liking, to dry Miss
Stephens’s bonnet, and dye Miss Tree’s stockings any colour but
blue:—but we heard from good authority that there was a new
tragedy worth seeing, and also that it was written by an old friend of
ours. <i>That</i> there was no resisting. So ‘we came, saw, and were
satisfied.’—Virginius is a good play:—we repeat it. It is a real
tragedy; a sound historical painting. Mr. Knowles has taken the
facts as he found them, and expressed the feelings that would naturally
arise out of the occasion. Strange to say, in this age of poetical
egotism, the author, in writing his play, has been thinking of Virginius
and his daughter, more than of himself! This is the true imagination,
to put yourself in the place of others, and to feel and speak for them.
Our unpretending poet travels along the high road of nature and the
human heart; and does not turn aside to pluck pastoral flowers in
primrose lanes, or hunt gilded butterflies over enamelled meads,
breathless and exhausted;—nor does he, with vain ambition, ‘strike
his lofty head against the stars.’ So far indeed, he may thank the
Gods for not having made him poetical. Some cold, formal, affected,
and interested critics have not known what to make of this. It was
not what <i>they</i> would have done. One finds fault with the style as
poor, because it is not inflated. Another can see nothing in it,
because it is not interlarded with modern metaphysical theories,
unknown to the ancients. A third declares that it is all borrowed
from Shakspear, because it is true to nature. A fourth pronounces
it a superior kind of melodrame, because it pleases the public. The
two last things to which the dull and envious ever think of attributing
the success of any work (and yet the only ones to which genuine
success is attributable), are Genius and Nature. The one they hate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>and of the other they are ignorant. The same critics who despise
and slur the Virginius of Covent Garden, praise the Virginius and
the David Rizzio of Drury Lane, because (as it should appear)
there is nothing in <i>them</i> to rouse their dormant spleen, stung equally
by merit or success, and to mortify their own ridiculous, inordinate,
and hopeless vanity. Their praise is of a piece with their censure;
and equally from what they applaud and what they condemn, you
perceive the principle of their perverse judgments. They are soothed
with flatness and failure, and doat over them with parental fondness;
but what is above their strength, and demands their admiration, they
shrink from with loathing, and an oppressive sense of their own
imbecility: and what they dare not openly condemn, they would
willingly secrete from the public ear! We have described this class
of critics more than once, but they breed still: all that we can do is
to sweep them from our path as often as we meet with them, and to
remove their dirt and cobwebs as fast as they proceed from the same
noisome source. Besides the merits of Virginius as a literary composition,
it is admirably adapted to the stage. It presents a succession
of pictures. We might suppose each scene almost to be copied from
a beautiful bas-relief, or to have formed a group on some antique
vase. ‘’Tis the taste of the ancients, ’tis classical lore.’ But it is a
speaking and a living picture we are called upon to witness. These
figures so strikingly, so simply, so harmoniously combined, start into
life and action, and breathe forth words, the soul of passion—inflamed
with anger, or melting with tenderness. Several passages of great
beauty were cited in a former article on this subject; but we might
mention in addition, the fine imaginative apostrophe of Virginius to
his daughter, when the story of her birth is questioned:</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>This is the true language of nature and passion; and all that we
can wish for, or require, in dramatic writing. If such language is
not poetical, it is the fault of poets, who do not write as the heart
dictates! We have seen plays that produced much more tumultuous
applause; none scarcely that excited more sincere sympathy. There
were no clap-traps, no sentiments that were the understood signals for
making a violent uproar; but we heard every one near us express
heartfelt and unqualified approbation; and tears more precious supplied
the place of loud huzzas. Each spectator appeared to appeal to, and
to judge from the feelings of his own breast, not from vulgar clamour;
and we trust the success will be more lasting and secure, as its
foundations are laid in the deep and proud humility of nature.
Mr. Knowles owes every thing, that an author can owe, to the
actors; and they owed every thing to their attention to truth and to
real feeling. Mr. Macready’s Virginius is his best and most faultless
performance,—at once the least laboured and the most effectual.
His fine, manly voice sends forth soothing, impassioned tones, that
seem to linger round, or burst with terrific grandeur from the home
of his heart. Mr. Kemble’s Icilius was heroic, spirited, fervid, the
Roman warrior and lover; and Miss Foote was ‘the freeborn Roman
maid,’ with a little bit, a delightful little bit, of the English schoolgirl
in her acting. We incline to the <i>ideal</i> of our own country-women
after all, when they are so young, so innocent, so handsome. We
are both pleased and sorry to hear a report which threatens us with
the loss of so great a favourite; and one chief source of our regret
will be, that she will no longer play Virginia. The scenery allotted
to this tragedy encumbered the stage, and the simplicity of the play.
Temples and pictured monuments adorned the scene, which were not
in existence till five hundred years after the date of the story; and
the ruins of the Capitol, of Constantine’s arch, and the temple of
Jupiter Stator, frowned at once on the death of Virginia, and the
decline and fall of the Roman empire. As to the dresses, we leave
them to our deputy of the wardrobe; but, we believe, they were got
right at last, with some trouble. In the printed play, we observe a
number of passages marked with inverted commas, which are omitted
in the representation. This is the case almost uniformly wherever
the words ‘Tyranny,’ or ‘Liberty,’ occur. Is this done by authority,
or is it prudence in the author, ‘<i>lest the courtiers offended should be?</i>’
Is the name of Liberty to be struck out of the English language, and
are we not to hate tyrants even in an old Roman play? ‘Let the
galled jade wince: our withers are unwrung.’ We turn to a pleasanter
topic, and are glad to find an old and early friend unaltered in sentiment
as he is unspoiled by success:—the same boy-poet, after a lapse of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>years, as when we first knew him; unconscious of the wreath he has
woven round his brow, laughing and talking of his play just as if it
had been written by any body else, and as simple-hearted, downright,
and honest as the unblemished work he has produced!<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c015'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>We saw Mr. Kean at his benefit at the risk of our limbs, and are
sorry for the accident that happened to himself in the course of the
evening. We have longed ever since we saw Mr. Kean—that is,
any time these six years—to see him jump through a trap-door—hearing
he could do it. ‘Why are those things hid? Is this a
time to conceal virtues?’ said we to ourselves. What was our
disappointment, then, when on the point of this consummation of our
wishes—just in the moment of the projection of our hopes—when
dancing with Miss Valancy too, he broke the tendon Achilles, and
down fell all our promised pleasure, our castles in the air! Good-reader,
it was not the jump through the trap-door that we wished
literally to see; but the leap from Othello to Harlequin. What a
jump! What an interval, what a gulph to pass! What an elasticity
of soul and body too—what a diversity of capacity in the same
diminutive person! To be Othello, a man should be all passion,
abstraction, imagination: to be Harlequin, he should have his wits
in his heels, and in his fingers’ ends! To be both, is impossible,
or miraculous. Each doubles the wonder of the other; and in
judging of the aggregate amount of merit, we must proceed, not by
the rules of addition, but multiply Harlequin’s lightness into Othello’s
gravity, and the result will give us the sum total of Mr. Kean’s
abilities. What a spring, what an expansive force of mind, what
an untamed vigour, to rise to such a height from such a lowness;
to tower like a Phoenix from its ashes; to ascend like a pyramid of
fire! Why, what a complex piece of machinery is here; what an
involution of faculties, circle within circle, that enables the same
individual to make a summersault, and that swells the veins of his
forehead with true artificial passion, and that turns him to a marble
statue with thought! It is not being educated in the fourth form of
St. Paul’s school, or cast in the antique mould of the high Roman
fashion, that can do this; but it is genius alone that can raise a man
thus above his first origin, and make him thus various from himself!
It is bestriding the microcosm of man like a Colossus, and, by
uniting the extremes of the chain of being, seemingly implies all the
intermediate links. We do not think much of Mr. Kean’s singing:
we could, with a little practice and tuition, sing nearly as well ourselves:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>as for his dancing, it is but <i>so so</i>, and anybody can dance:
his fencing is good, nervous, firm, fibrous, like that of a new pocket
Hercules:—but for his jumping through a hole in the wall,—clean
through, head over heels, like a shot out of culverin—‘by Heavens,
it would have been great!’ This we fully expected at his hands,
and ‘in this expectation we were baulked.’ Just as our critical
expectations were on tip-toe, Mr. Kean suddenly strained his
ancle:—as it were to spite us;—we went out in dudgeon, and were
near missing his Imitations, which would not have signified much if
we had. They were tolerable, indifferent, pretty good, but not the
thing. Mr. Matthews’s or Mr. Yates’s are better. They were
softened down, and fastidious. Kemble was not very like. Incledon
and Braham were the best, and Munden was very middling. The
after-piece of the Admirable Crichton, in which he was to do all
this, was neither historical nor dramatic. The character, which
might have given excellent opportunities for the display of a variety
of extraordinary accomplishments in the real progress of the story,
was ill-conceived and ill-managed. He was made either a pedagogue
or an antic. In himself, he was dull and grave, instead of being
high-spirited, volatile, and self-sufficient; and to show off his abilities,
he was put into masquerade. We did not like it at all; though, from
the prologue, we had expected more point and daring. Mr. Kean’s
Jaffier was fine, and in some parts admirable. This indeed, is only
to say that he played it. But it was not one of his finest parts, nor
indeed one in which we expected him to shine pre-eminently: but
on that we had not depended, for we never know beforehand what he
will do best or worst. He is one of those wandering fires, whose
orbit is not calculable by any known rules of criticism. Mr.
Elliston’s Pierre, was, we are happy to say, a spirited and effectual
performance. We must not forget to add that Mrs. M’Gibbon’s
Belvidera was excellent, declaimed with impassioned propriety, and
acted with dignity and grace.</p>

<p class='c021'>‘And what of this new opera of David Rizzio, that the <cite>New
Times</cite> makes such a rout about?’—Nothing. ‘Nothing can come
of nothing.’ We truly and strictly could not make a word of sense
of it. We wonder whose it can be. It is praised too in the
Chronicle; but that is no matter. The story promised much; the
music, the old Scotch tunes, more. They were both completely <i>transmogrified</i>,—they
melted into thin air. The author set aside the
one, and the composers (of whom there are no less than five)
the other. This required some ingenuity. The plot turns altogether
upon this, that Rizzio (Braham) is supposed and made to be in love
with Lady Mary Livingstone (Miss Carew), and by warbling out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>her Christian name in ballads in the open air, is imagined, by Darnley
and the rest, to be in love with Mary, Queen of Scots (Mrs. West),
from which strange misinterpretation all the mischief and confusion
ensue. We fancy there is no foundation for this in tradition or old
records. The author has indeed reversed the method of the writer
of the Scotch Novels, for, instead of building as much as possible on
facts and history, he has built as little as possible on them—and has
produced just the contrary effect of the Great Unknown, that is,
has spun a tissue of incidents and sentiments out of his own head,
worth nothing, unmeaning, feeble, languid, disjointed, and for the
most part, incomprehensible. Most of the scenes in the two first
acts, consisted of the Exits and Entrances of single persons, who only
appeared to deliver an introductory speech, and sing a song, and
then vanished before any one else could come on to entrap them into
a dialogue—a delicate evasion of the wily dramatist! Mr. Barnard
repeated these Operatic soliloquies so often, as to be almost hissed off
the stage, and Miss Povey (his sweetheart) by coming to his relief
half a minute after he was gone, did not much mend the matter,
either by the charms of her voice or person. This young lady is
pretty, and sings agreeably enough, but we do not see what she can
have to do with romantic sentiments or situations. Some of those in
which she was placed, would require the utmost delicacy of the most
accomplished heroine to carry them off without an obtrusive sense of
impropriety. For instance, after warbling a ditty to the desert air
of Holyrood House, she retires into a summer-house hard by, to
keep an assignation with the persuasive Mr. Barnard, and is presently
surprised and carried off, instead of the silver-voiced Carew, by a
band of ruffians, who—on her making many exclamations, and
repeating ‘Oh! dear me!’ and saying she only came to meet a
young man—reply very laconically, ‘Aye, you came to meet one
young man, and now you have met with four—that’s better!’ In
the last scene, the catastrophe is brought about by Rizzio’s being
discovered by the conspirators at a magnificent entertainment in the
apartment of the Queen, which confirms their former suspicions and
infuriates their revenge; and he is hurried from her frantic embraces,
which display all the tenderness of a mistress, rather than the attachment
of a sovereign, to be despatched in the adjoining chamber.
His assassins find their error too late, when, from the passionate
declaration of Lady Mary Livingstone that she is his wife, they are
convinced of his and the Queen’s innocence. The lesson to be
drawn from this fiction, seems to be, that ladies (whether Princesses
or not) who defy opinion, must take the consequences of their
infatuated self-indulgence, or involve others in ruin: for the presumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>is, that no woman in her senses will risk her character,
unless she has a further object in view, namely, to gratify her passions.
This was not, however, the inference drawn by the generality of the
audience; for several passages, construed in allusion to passing events,
were loudly and triumphantly cheered. They, indeed, saved the
piece from final and absolute damnation, for it drooped from the
beginning, and to the end, and had no other interest than what arose
from the occasional parallelism of political situations. Mr. Braham
(as David Rizzio) disappointed us much. He sung the airs he had
probably himself selected, without any affectation indeed—‘softly
sweet in Lydian measures’—but without any effect whatever upon
our ears; he fell into simplicity and insipidity, plump together, ten
thousand fathoms down. The other singers acquitted themselves
very well, but there was nothing to excite an interest in itself, or to
answer the previous expectations arising from the title of the piece.
We had hoped to have been treated to some old Scotch airs, at least:
but the joint-composers seemed to have a strong aversion to any
thing connected with the sound of a bagpipe. This we suppose is
a symptom of the progress of a more refined taste among us. The
causes of our want of sympathy with it have been explained above.
The piece has been repeated once or twice since.</p>

<p class='c021'>Giovanni in London has been transferred to this theatre (Drury
Lane) from the Olympic. It was a favourite with the town there;
it has become a favourite with the town here. There is something
in burlesque that pleases. We like to see the great degraded to a
level with the little. The humour is extravagant and coarse, but it
is certainly droll; and we never check our inclinations to laugh,
when we have an opportunity given us. We have not laughed so
heartily a long time, as at seeing the meddlesome lawyer tossed in
a blanket in the King’s Bench; and we should imagine there is a
natural and inevitable connection between the performance of that
gentle salutary mode of discipline, and the titillation of the lungs of
the spectators. Madame Vestris played, sung, and looked the
incorrigible Don John very prettily and spiritedly; but, we confess,
we had rather see her petticoated than in a Spanish doublet and hose,
hat and feather. Yet she gave a life to the scene, and Pluto relented
as she sung. There is a pulpy softness and ripeness in her lips, a
roseate hue, like the leaves of the damask rose, a luscious honeyed
sound in her voice, a depth and fulness too, as if it were clogged with
its own sweets, a languid archness, an Italian lustre in her eye, an
enchanting smile, a mouth—shall we go on? No. But she is more
bewitching even than Miss Brunton. Yet we like to see her best in
petticoats. It cannot be denied that Mrs. Gould (late Miss Burrell)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>of the Olympic, who played it first, was the girl to play Giovanni in
London. She had a hooked nose, large staring eyes, a manlike
voice, a tall person, a strut that became a rake.</p>

to brazen the matter out. On the night we saw this afterpiece,

from his having lost a tooth in front, nor to see Mr. Jones’s eyes
roll more meteorous than ever. At the larger theatres we only
discover that the ladies paint red: at the smaller ones we can
distinguish when they paint white. We see defects enough at a
distance, and we can always get near enough (in the pit) to see the
beauties. Those who go to the boxes do not go to see the play,
but to make a figure, and be thought something of themselves (so
far they probably succeed, at least in their own opinion): and if
the Gods cannot hear, they make themselves heard. We do not
like <i>private theatricals</i>. We like every thing to be what it is. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>have no fancy for seeing the actors look like part of the audience,
nor for seeing the pit invade the boxes, nor the boxes shake hands
with the galleries. We are for a proper distinction of ranks—at the
theatre. While we are laughing at the broad farcical humour of
the Agreeable Surprise, or critically examining Mrs. Mardyn’s dress
in the Will, we do not care to be disturbed by some idle whisper,
or mumbling disapprobation of an old beau, or antiquated dowager
in a high head-dress, close at our ear, but in a different part of the
house.—Mr. Arnold has taken care of this at the New English
Opera-house in the Strand, of which he is proprietor and patentee.
The ‘Great Vulgar and the Small’ (as Cowley has it) are there
kept at a respectful distance. The boxes are perched up so high
above the pit, that it gives you a head-ache to look up at the beauty
and fashion that nightly adorn them with their thin and scattered
constellations; and then the gallery is ‘raised so high above all
height,’ it is nearly impossible for the eye to scale it, while a little
miserable shabby upper-gallery is partitioned off with an iron railing,
through which the poor one-shilling devils look like half-starved
prisoners in the Fleet, and are a constant butt of ridicule to the
genteeler rabble beneath them. Then again (so vast is Mr. Arnold’s
genius for separating and combining), you have a Saloon, a sweet
pastoral retreat, where any love-sick melancholy swain, or romantic
nymph, may take a rural walk to Primrose-hill, or Chalk-farm, by
the side of painted purling streams, and sickly flowering shrubs,
without once going out of the walls of the theatre:—</p>

<p class='c021'>If the Haymarket has been praised by a contemporary critic (of
whom we might say, that he is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alter et idem</span></i>) for being as hot as an
oven in the midst of the dog-days; the Lyceum, on the other hand,
is as cool as a well; and much might, we think, be said on both
sides. As a matter of taste, or fancy, or prejudice, (we shall not
pretend to say which) we do not greatly like the new English
Opera-house. The house is <i>new</i>, the pieces are <i>new</i>, the company
are <i>new</i>, and we do not know what to make of any of them. As
to the things that are acted there, they are a sort of pert, patched-up,
insipid, flippant attempt at mediocrity. They are like the odd-ends
and scraps of all the rejected pieces, which have come into the
manager’s possession in virtue of his office for a length of time; and
which he has stitched and tacked together in such a way that neither
the authors nor the public can know any thing of the matter. They
are a condensed essence of all the vapid stuff that has been suppressed
at home or acted abroad for a number of years last past. Visions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>farces, operas, and interludes, thin, blue, fluttering, gawzy appearances,
mock the empty sight, elude the public comprehension, and the critic’s
grasp. The worst of these slender, wire-drawn productions is, that
there is nothing to praise in them, nor any thing to condemn. They
‘present no mark’ to friend or foe. ‘You may as well take aim at
the edge of a pen-knife,’ as try to pick any thing out of them. They
are trifling, tedious, frivolous, and vexatious. The best is, they do
not last long, and ‘one bubble’ (to borrow an illusion from an
eloquent divine, in treating on a graver subject) ‘knocks another on
the head, and both rush together into oblivion!’—Miss Kelly is
here; she might as well be a hundred miles off. She is not good
at child’s play, at the <i>make-believe</i> fine-lady, or the <i>make-believe</i>
waiting-maid. Hers is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> downright acting, and she must
have something to do, in order to do it properly. She is too clever
and too knowing to act a part totally without meaning, such as that
lately given her in the Promissory Note. Such was not her Yarico.
Ah! there were tones, and looks, and piercing sighs in her representation
of the fond, injured, sun-burnt Indian maid, that make it
difficult to think of her in any inferior part, or to speak slightingly
of any theatre in which she is concerned: but critics, as it has been
said of judges, must not give way to their feelings. There is Wrench
here too, as easy as an old glove, the same careless, hair-brained,
idle, impudent, good humoured, lackadaisical sort of a gentleman as
ever; there is Harley too, who has not been spoiled by the town,
since we first saw him here:—then there is Mr. Rowbotham, a
grave young man, a new hand, very like the real, the prudent Mr.
Thomas Inkle: <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore un coup</span></i>, we have Mr. Bartley, who, if not a
new hand, is fresh returned from America, and as much at home on
these boards as before he went abroad: in the Governor of Barbadoes,
he had quite a Transatlantic look with him: there is also Mr.
Westbourn (we think he is at this house) and a Mr. Wilkinson,
and a Mr. Richardson (whose names and persons we are apt to
confound together), and Mr. Pearman (whom it is not possible to
mistake for any one else) and Miss Stevenson (a very provoking
young thing), and Miss Love, and Mrs. Grove, and a whole <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylva
Critica</span></i> of actors and actresses, of whom the very nomenclature
terrifies us. We give it up in despair: and so humbly take our
leave of the New English Opera house for the season!—‘We had
rather be taxed for silence, than checked for speech.’</p>

<p class='c021'>At the other house, to which we ‘do more favourably incline,’
both from old associations and immediate liking, though there are
some raw recruits (picked up we don’t know where), there is a
large and powerful detachment from the veteran corps of Covent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>Garden; Terry, Jones, Mrs. Gibbs, Liston, Mr. and Mrs. Charles
Kemble, J. Russel, Farley, and Mrs. Mardyn and Madame Vestris
from Drury-Lane, and last, Miss R. Corri, from the Opera House.—In
fact, it is our opinion that there is theatrical strength enough
in this town only to set up one good summer or one good winter
theatre. Competition may be necessary to prevent negligence and
abuse, but the result of this distribution of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps dramatique</span></i> into
different companies, is, that we never, or very rarely indeed, see a
play well acted in all its parts. At Drury-Lane there is only one
tragic actor, Mr. Kean: all the rest are supernumeraries. No one,
we apprehend, would ever cross the threshold to see Mr. Pope’s
Iago, or Mr. Elliston’s Richmond, or Mr. Rae’s Bassanio, or Mr.
Hamblin, or Mr. Penley, or Mr. Fisher, or Mr. Philips, who plays
the King in Hamlet: though, ‘in the catalogue they go for actors.’
In comedy, Drury-Lane is better off: yet, they cannot get up a real
sterling comedy, for want of actors and actresses to fill the parts of
<i>gentlemen</i> and <i>ladies</i>. Miss Kelly is the best comic actress on either
stage, but she is only an appendage to the real fine lady, Millamant’s
Mrs. Mincing, ‘to curl her hair so crisp and pure’: in cases of
necessity, they have no one but Mr. Penley, jun. to top the part
of Lord Foppington: Mr. Munden is their Sir Peter Teazle, and
Mr. Elliston is his own Lord Townley. But they really hit off a
modern comedy, such as Wild Oats, which is a mixture of farce and
romantic sentiment, to an exact perfection. At Covent-Garden they
lately had one great tragic actress, Miss O’Neill; and two or three
actors who were highly respectable, at least in second-rate tragic
characters. At present, the female throne in tragedy is vacant; and
of the men ‘who rant and fret their hour upon the stage,’ Mr.
Macready is the only one who draws houses, or who finds admirers.
He shines most, however, in the pathos of domestic life; and we
still want to see tragedy, ‘turretted, crowned, and crested, with its
front gilt, and blood-stained,’ stooping from the skies (not raised
from the earth) as it did in the person of John Kemble. He is
now quaffing health and burgundy in the south of France. He
perhaps finds the air that blows from the ‘vine-covered hills’
wholesomer than that of a crowded house; and the lengthened
murmurs of the Mediterranean shores more soothing to the soul,
than the deep thunders of the pit. Or does he sometimes recline
his lofty, laurelled head upon the sea-beat beach, and unlocking the
cells of memory, listen to the rolling Pæans, the loud never-to-be-forgotten
plaudits of enraptured multitudes, that mingle with the
music of the waves,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘And murmur as the Ocean murmurs near?’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>Or does he still ‘sigh his soul towards England’ and the busy hum
of Covent-Garden? If we thought so, (but that we dread all
returns from Elba) we would say to him, ‘Come back, and once
more bid Britannia rival old Greece and Rome!’—Or where is Mr.
Young now? There is an opening for <i>his</i> pretensions too.—If the
Drury-Lane company are deficient in genteel comedy, we fear that
Covent-Garden cannot help them out in this respect. Mr. W.
Farren is the only exception to the sweeping clause we were going
to insert against them. He plays the old gentleman, the antiquated
beau of the last age, very much after the fashion that we remember
to have seen in our younger days, and that is quite a singular
excellence in this. Is it that Mr. Farren has caught glimpses of
this character in real life, hovering in the horizon of the sister
kingdom, which has been long banished from this? They have
their Castle Rack-rents, their moats and ditches, still extant in remote
parts of the interior: and perhaps in famed Dublin city, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cheveux-de-fris</span></i>
of dress, the trellis-work of lace and ruffles, the masked battery
of compliment, the port-cullises of formal speech, the whole artillery
of sighs and ogling, with all the appendages and proper costume of
the ancient regime, and paraphernalia of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">preux chevalier</span></i>, may have
been kept up in a state of lively decrepitude and smiling dilapidation,
in a few straggling instances from the last century, which Mr. Farren
had seen. The present age produces nothing of the sort; and so,
according to our theory, Mr. Farren does not play the young gentleman
or modern man of fashion, though he is himself a young man.
For the rest, comedy is in a rich, thriving state at Covent-Garden,
as far as the lower kind of comic humour is concerned; but it is like
an ill-baked pudding, where all the plums sink to the bottom.
Emery and Liston, the two best, are of this description: Jones is
a caricaturist; and Terry, in his graver parts, is not a comedian, but
a moralist.—Even a junction of the two companies into one would
hardly furnish out one set of players competent to do justice to any
of the standard productions of the English stage in tragedy or
comedy: what a hopeful project it must be then to start a few more
play-houses in the heart of the metropolis as nurseries of histrionic
talent, still more to divide and dissipate what little concentration of
genius we have, and still more to weaken and distract public
patronage? As to the argument in favour of two or more theatres
from the necessity of competition, we shall not dispute it; but the
actual benefits are not so visible to our dim eyes as to some others.
There is a competition in what is bad as well as in what is good: the
race of popularity is as often gained by tripping up the heels of
your antagonist, as by pressing forward yourself: there is a competition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>in running an indifferent piece, or a piece indifferently acted,
to prevent the success of the same piece at the other house; and
there is a competition in puffing, as Mr. Elliston can witness.—No,
there we confess, he leaves all competition behind!</p>

<p class='c021'>The two pleasantest pieces we have seen this season at the
Haymarket are the Green Man, and Pigeons and Crows. They
were both to us an Agreeable Surprise; for we had not seen them
when they were brought out last year, or the year before. The
first is moral and pointed; the latter more lively and quaint. The
Green Man abounds in laconic good sense: in Pigeons and Crows
there is as edifying a vein of nonsense. We do not know the author
of this last piece (to whom we confess ourselves obliged for two
mirthful, thoughtless evenings), but we understand that the Green
Man is adapted by Mr. Jones from a French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petite pièce</span></i>, which was
itself taken from a German novel, we believe one of Kotzebue’s.
The sentiments indeed are evidently of that romantic, levelling cast,
which formerly abounded in the writings of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</span></i> philanthropic
enthusiast. The principal character in it is that of the Green Man
himself, who is a benevolent, blunt-spoken, friendly cynic. The
only joke of the character consists in his being dressed all in green—he
has a green coat, a green waistcoat and breeches, green stockings,
a green hat, a green pocket handkerchief, and a green watch. This
gives rise to many pleasant allusions; and indeed, from the manner
in which the peculiarity of his personal appearance affects our notion
of his personal identity, he looks like a talking suit of clothes, a
sermonizing and sententious vegetable. Mr. Terry performs the
part admirably, and seems himself transformed into ‘a brother of
the groves.’ He does not aggravate the author’s meaning too much,
but gives just as much point as was intended, and passes on to what
comes next, as naturally, and with that sort of manner and unconscious
interest which a man really takes in his own, or other people’s affairs.
Mr. Terry’s acting always shows vigour and good sense. His only
fault is, that he is too jealous of himself, and strives to do better than
well. In the Green Man he was quite at home, and quite at his
ease; and made every one else feel equally so. Mr. Jones is an
overstarched French fop in this play, full of foreign grimace and
affectation, of which, however, he is cured by his passion for the fair
ward of the Green Man (Miss Leigh, a very pleasing new actress),
who does not at all tolerate such impertinence, and he afterwards
turns out (<i>dandyism</i> apart) a very good sort of a humane character.
Perhaps, enough has never been made on the stage of the frequent
contradiction in this respect between outside appearances and sterling
qualities within. We carry our prejudices both for and against dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>too far. It is no rule either way. A fop is not necessarily a fool,
nor without feeling. A man may even wear stays, and not be
effeminate; or a pink coat, without making his friends blush for him.
The celebrated beau, Hervey, threw the scavenger that ridiculed
him into his own mud-cart; and a person in our own time, who has
carried extravagance of dress and appearance to a very great pitch
indeed, is, in reality, a very good-natured, sensible, modest man.
The fault, in such cases, is neither in the head nor heart, but in the
cut of a coat-collar, or the size of a pair of whiskers.—Farley and
J. Russell were Major Dumpling and Captain Bibber in the same
piece: and a scene of high farce they made of it. The one is an
officer in the army, the <i>local militia</i>; the other is an officer in the
navy. The one excels in eating, the other in drinking. The one
is most at home in the kitchen, the other in the cellar. The one is
fat, huge, and unwieldy; the other, dapper, tight, and bustling.
Farley is an actor with whose merit, in such parts, the public are
well acquainted: Russel is one who will be liked more, the more he is
known. Both in Captain Bibber, Blondeau, the French showman in
Pigeons and Crows, and in Silvester Daggerwood, he has acquitted
himself with great applause, and entered into the humour, eccentricity,
and peculiar distinctions of his characters, with spirit and fidelity.
His mimicry is also good, and he sings a French rondeau, or a
sailor’s ditty, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">con amore</span></i>. The part of Major Dumpling was originally
played by Mr. Tokely. It was one of three parts (Crockery and
Peter Pastoral were the other two) for which he seemed born, and
having rolled himself up in them, like the silk-worm, he died. Poor
Tokely! He relished his parts; with Crockery doated over an old
sign-post, or wept with honest Peter over a green leaf.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘His tears were tears of oil and gladness.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>But he also relished his morning’s draught, and sipped the sweets till
he was drowned in a butt of whiskey. The said fair-looking, round-faced,
pot-bellied, uncouth, awkward, out-of-the-way, unmeaning,
inimitable Crockery, or Peter Pastoral, or Major Dumpling, was
the very little child that, in the year 1796, Kemble used to carry off
triumphantly on his arm in the original performance of Pizarro!
Thinking of these things, may we not say, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic transit gloria mundi</span></i>?
So flies the stage away, and life flies after it as fast!—Mrs. Gibbs,
‘that horse-whipping woman,’ in Teazing made Easy, does not,
however, wear the willow on his account, but looks as smiling, as
good-humoured, as buxom, as in the natural and professional life-time
of Mr. Tokely, and drinks her bowl of cream as Cowslip, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>expresses her liking of a roast-duck with the same resignation of flesh
and spirit as ever.</p>

<p class='c021'>Mr. Liston in Pigeons and Crows plays the part of Sir Peter
Pigwiggin, knight, alderman, and pin-maker. What a name, what
a person, and what a representative! We never saw Mr. Liston’s
countenance in better preservation; that is, it seems tumbling all in
pieces with indescribable emotions, and a thousand odd twitches, and
unaccountable absurdities, oozing out at every pore. His jaws seem
to ache with laughter: his eyes look out of his head with wonder:
his face is unctuous all over and bathed with jests; the tip of his
nose is tickled with conceit of himself, and his teeth chatter in his
head in the eager insinuation of a plot: his forehead speaks, and
his wig (not every particular hair, but the whole bewildered bushy
mass) ‘stands on end as life were in it.’ In the scene with his
dulcinea (Miss Leigh) his approaches are the height of self-complacent,
<i>cockney</i> courtship; his rhymes on his own projected marriage,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What a thing!</div>
      <div class='line'>Bless the King!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>would make any man (who is not so already) loyal, and his laughing
in the glass when he is told by mistake that Miss’s mamma is eighteen,
and his convulsive distortions as he recovers from his first surprise,
and the choking effects of it, out-Hogarth Hogarth!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Let those laugh now who never laugh’d before,</div>
      <div class='line'>And those who still have laugh’d, now laugh the more.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>The scene where he is told he is poisoned, and his interview with the
drunken apothecary (Mr. Williams), though excellent in themselves,
were not so good: for Liston does not play so well to any one else,
as he does to himself. The rest of the characters were well
supported. Jones, as the younger Pigwiggin, alias Captain Neville,
the lover of Liston’s fair inamorata, ‘does a little bit of fidgets’ very
well. He is sprightly, voluble, knowing, and pleasant; and is the
life of a small theatre, only that he is now and then a little too
obstreperous; but he keeps up the interest of his part, and that is
every thing. The audience delight to hear his ‘View Halloa’ before
he comes on the stage (which is a sure sign of their opinion), and
expect to be amused for the next ten minutes. If an actor can excite
hope, and not disappoint it, what can he do more? Mr. Russell, as
the little French showman, Mr. Farley as Mr. Wadd, and Mr.
Connor as a blundering Irish servant, all sustained their parts with
great eclat: and so did the ladies. The scene where Jones deceives
two of his creditors, Russell and Farley, by appointing each to pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>the other, had a very laughable effect; but the stratagem is borrowed
from Congreve, who indeed was not the very worst source to borrow
from.</p>

<p class='c021'>The house was crowded to excess to see the new appearances in
the Beggar’s Opera; Madame Vestris’s Captain Macheath, Miss
R. Corri’s Polly, and Mrs. Charles Kemble’s Lucy, which last,
indeed, is an old friend with a new face. Mrs. Kemble was the best
Lucy we ever saw (not excepting Miss Kelly, who is also much at
home in this part), and she retains all the spirit of her original
performances. Miss Kelly plays Lucy as naturally, perhaps more
so; but Mrs. Kemble does it more characteristically. She has no
‘compunctious visitings’ of delicacy, but her mind seems hardened
against the walls that enclose it. She is Lockitt’s daughter, the child
of a prison; the true virago, that is to be the foil to the gentle spirit
of Polly. The air with which she throws the rat to the cat in the
song has a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gusto</span></i> worthy of one of Michael Angelo’s Sybils; a box on
the ear from her right hand is no jesting matter. Her rage and
sullenness are of the true unmitigated stamp, and her affected civilities
to her fair rival are a parody (as the author intended) on the friendships
of courts.—Madame Vestris, as the Captain, almost shrunk
before her, like Viola before her enraged enemies. Indeed, she
played the part very prettily, with great vivacity and an agreeable
swagger, cocking her hat, throwing back her shoulders, and making
a free use of a rattan-cane, like Little Pickle, but she did not look
like the hero, or the highwayman, if this was desirable in her case.
If, however, she turned Macheath into a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit-maitre</span></i>, she did not play
it like Mr. Incledon or Mr. Cooke, or Mr. Braham, or Mr. Young,
or any one else we have seen in it, which is no small commendation.
Miss Corri sang <i>Cease your funning</i>, and one or two other songs, with
sweetness and effect; but, in general, she was more like a modern
made-up boarding-school girl, than the artless and elegant Polly.
She lisps and looks pretty. The other parts were very respectably
filled, but some of the best scenes (we are sorry to say it) were
left out.</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Drury Lane.</span>—The following is a play-bill of this theatre, for
which we paid two-pence on the spot, to verify the fact—as some
well-disposed persons, to prevent mistakes, purchase libellous or
blasphemous publications from their necessitous or desperate vendors.</p>

<p class='c024'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span><i>Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.</i>—Agreeably to the former advertisement, this
theatre is now open for the last performances of Mr. Kean, before his
positive departure for America. This evening, Saturday, August 19, 1820,
his Majesty’s servants will perform Shakespear’s tragedy of Othello. Duke
of Venice, Mr. Thompson; Brabantio, Mr. Powell; Gratiano, Mr. Carr;
Lodovico, Mr. Vining; Montano, Mr. Jeffries; Othello, Mr. Kean—(his
last appearance in that character); Cassio, Mr. Bromley—(his first appearance

Moreton; Paulo, Mr. Read; Giovanni, Mr. Starmer; Luca, Mr. Randall;
Desdemona, Mrs. W. West; Emilia, Mrs. Egerton—This theatre overflows
every night. The patentees cannot condescend to enter into a competition
of scurrility which is only fitted for minor theatres—what their powers
really are, will be, without any public appeal, legally decided in November
next, and any gasconade can only be supposed to be caused by cunning or
poverty.—After which, the farce of Modern Antiques, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c024'>A more impudent puff, and heartless piece of bravado than this,
we do not remember to have witnessed. <i>This theatre does not overflow
every night.</i> As to the competition of scurrility, which the manager
declines, it is he who has commenced it. The minor theatres—that
is, one of them—to wit, the Lyceum—put forth a very proper and
well-grounded remonstrance against this portentous opening of the
winter theatre in the middle of the dog-days, to scorch up the dry,
meagre, hasty harvest of the summer ones:—at which our mighty
manager sets up his back, like the great cat, Rodilardus; scornfully
rejects their appeal to the public; says he will pounce upon them in
November with the law in his hands; and that, in the mean time, all
they can do to interest the public in their favour by a plain statement
of facts, ‘can only be supposed to be caused by <i>cunning</i> or <i>poverty</i>.’
This is pretty well for a manager who has been so <i>thanked</i> as
Mr. Elliston! His own committee may laud him for bullying other
theatres, but the public will have a feeling for his weaker rivals,
though the angry comedian ‘should threaten to swallow them up
quick,’ and vaunt of his action of battery against them, without any
public appeal, ‘when wind and rain beat dark November down.’
This sorry manager, ‘dressed’ (to use the words of the immortal
bard, whom he so modestly and liberally patronises) ‘dressed in a
little brief authority, plays such fantastic tricks before high Heaven,’—not
‘as make the angels weep,’—but his own candle-snuffers laugh,
and his own scene-shifters blush. He ought to be ashamed of himself.
Why, what a beggarly account of wretched actors, what an exposure
of the nakedness of the land, have we in this very play-bill, which is
issued forth with such a mixture of pomp and imbecility! Mr.
Kean’s name, indeed, stands pre-eminent in lordly capitals, in defiance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>of Mr. Dowton’s resentment,—and Junius Brutus Booth, in his way,
scorns to be <i>Mistered</i>! But all the rest are, we suppose—Mr.
Elliston’s friends. They are happy in the favour of the manager,
and in the total ignorance of the town! Mr. Kean, we grant, is in
himself a host; a sturdy column, supporting the tottering, tragic dome
of Drury-Lane! What will it be when this main, this sole striking
pillar is taken away—‘You take my house, when you do take the
prop that holds my house’—when the patentees shall have nothing to
look to for salvation but the puffing of the Great Lessee, and his
genius for law, which we grant may rival the Widow Black-acre’s—and
when the cries of Othello, of Macbeth, of Richard, and Sir
Giles, in the last agonies of their despair, shall be lost, through all
the long winter months, ‘over a vast and unhearing ocean?’ Mr.
Elliston, instead of taking so much pains to announce his own
approaching dissolution, had better let Mr. Kean pass in silence, and
take his <i>positive departure for America</i> without the pasting of placards,
and the dust and clatter of a law-suit in Westminster Hall. It is not
becoming in him, W. R. Elliston, Esq., comedian, formerly proprietor
of the Surrey and the Olympic, and author of a pamphlet on
the unwarrantable encroachments of the Theatres-royal, now to insult
over the plea of self-defence and self-preservation, set up by his
brethren of the minor play-houses, as the resource of ‘poverty and
cunning!’—‘It is not friendly, it is not gentlemanly. The profession,
as well as Mr. Arnold, may blame him for it:’ but the patentees will
no doubt thank him at their next quarterly meeting.</p>

<p class='c028'>Mr. Kean’s Othello the other night did not quite answer our
over-wrought expectations. He played it <i>with variations</i>; and
therefore, necessarily worse. There is but one perfect way of
playing Othello, and that was the way in which he used to play it.
To see him in this character at his best, may be reckoned among the
consolations of the human mind. It is to feel our hearts bleed by
sympathy with another; it is to vent a world of sighs for another’s
sorrows; to have the loaded bosom ‘cleansed of that perilous stuff
that weighs upon the soul,’ by witnessing the struggles and the mortal
strokes that ‘flesh is heir to.’ We often seek this deliverance from
private woes through the actor’s obstetric art; and it is hard when he
disappoints us, either from indifference or wilfulness. Mr. Kean did
not repeat his admired farewell apostrophe to Content, with that fine
‘organ-stop’ that he used,—as if his inmost vows and wishes were
ascending to the canopy of Heaven, and their sounding echo were
heard upon the earth like distant thunder,—but in a querulous,
whining, sobbing tone, which we do not think right. Othello’s spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>does not sink under, but supports itself on the retrospect of the past;
and we should hear the lofty murmurs of his departing hopes, his
ambition and his glory, borne onward majestically ‘to the passing
wind.’ He pronounced the ‘not a jot, not a jot,’ as an hysteric
exclamation, not with the sudden stillness of fixed despair. As we
have seen him do this part before, his lips uttered the words, but they
produced and were caused by no corresponding emotion in his breast.
They were breath just playing on the surface of his mind, but that
did not penetrate to the soul. His manner of saying to Cassio, ‘But
never more be officer of mine,’ was in a tone truly terrific, magnificent,
prophetic; and the only alteration we remarked as an improvement.
We have adverted to this subject here, because we think Mr. Kean
cannot wisely outdo himself. He is always sufficiently original,
sufficiently in extremes, and when he attempts to vary from himself,
and go still farther, we think he has no alternative but to run
into extravagance. It is true it may be said of him that he is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Never so sure our passion to create,</div>
      <div class='line'>As when he treads the brink of all we hate—’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c022'>but still one step over the precipice is destruction. We also fear that
the critical soil of America is slippery ground. Jonathan is inclined
to the safe side of things, even in matters of taste and fancy. They
are a little formal and common-place in those parts. They do not
like liberties in morals, nor excuse poetical licenses. They do not
tolerate the privileges of birth, or readily sanction those of genius.
A very little excess above the water-mark of mediocrity is with them
quite enough. Mr. Kean will do well not to offend by extraordinary
efforts, or dazzling eccentricities. He should be the Washington of
actors, the modern Fabius. If he had been educated in the fourth
form of St. Paul’s school, like some other top-tragedians that we
know, we should say to him, in classic terms, <i>in medio tutissimus ibis</i>.
‘Remember that they hiss the Beggar’s Opera in America. If they
do not spare Captain Macheath, do you think they will spare you?
Play off no pranks in the United States. Do not think to redeem
great vices by great virtues. They are inexorable to the one, and
insensible to the other. Reserve all works of supererogation till you
come back, and have safely run the gauntlet of New York, of
Philadelphia, of Baltimore, and Boston. Think how Mr. Young
would act,—and act with a little more meaning, and a little less pomp
than he would—who, we are assured on credible authority, is that
model of indifference that the New World would worship and bow
down before.’—We have made bold to offer this advice, because we
wish well to Mr. Kean; and because we wish to think as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>possible of a republican public. We watch both him and them
‘with the rooted malice of a friend.’ We have thus paid our respects
to Old Drury in holiday-time; and thought we had already taken
leave of the New English Opera-House for the season. But there
were <span class='sc'>Two Words</span> to that bargain. The farce with this title is a
very lively little thing, worth going to see; and the new Dramatic
Romance (or whatever it is called) of the <span class='sc'>Vampyre</span> is, upon the
whole, the most splendid <i>spectacle</i> we have ever seen. It is taken
from a French piece, founded on the celebrated story so long bandied
about between Lord Byron, Mr. Shelley, and Dr. Polidori, which
last turned out to be the true author. As a mere fiction, and as a
fiction attributed to Lord Byron, whose genius is chartered for the
land of horrors, the original story passed well enough: but on the
stage it is a little shocking to the feelings, and incongruous to the
sense, to see a spirit in human shape,—in the shape of a real Earl,
and, what is more, of a <i>Scotch</i> Earl—going about seeking whom it
may marry and then devour, to lengthen out its own abhorred and
anomalous being. Allowing for the preternatural atrocity of the
fable, the situations were well imagined and supported: the acting of
Mr. T. P. Cooke (from the Surry Theatre) was spirited and imposing,
and certainly Mrs. W. H. Chatterley, as the daughter of his
friend the Baron, (Mr. Bartley), and his destined bride, bid fair to be
a very delectable victim. She is however saved in a surprizing
manner, after a rapid succession of interesting events, to the great joy
of the spectator. The scenery of this piece is its greatest charm, and
it is inimitable. We have seen sparkling and overpowering effects of
this kind before; but to the splendour of a transparency were here
added all the harmony and mellowness of the finest painting. We
do not speak of the vision at the beginning, or of that at the end of
the piece,—though these were admirably managed,—so much as of
the representation of the effects of moonlight on the water and on the
person of the dying knight. The hue of the sea-green waves, floating
in the pale beam under an arch-way of grey weather-beaten rocks, and
with the light of a torch glaring over the milder radiance, was in as
fine keeping and strict truth as Claude or Rembrandt, and would
satisfy, we think, the most fastidious artist’s eye. It lulled the sense
of sight as the fancied sound of the dashing waters soothed the
imagination. In the scene where the moonlight fell on the dying
form of Ruthven (the Vampire) it was like a fairy glory, forming a
palace of emerald light: the body seemed to drink its balmy essence,
and to revive in it without a miracle. The line,</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>came into the mind from the beauty and gorgeousness of the picture,
notwithstanding the repugnance of every circumstance and feeling.
This melodrame succeeds very well; and it succeeds in spite of
Mr. Kean’s last nights, and without Miss Kelly!</p>

<p class='c021'>At the Hay-market there has been a new comedy, called ‘the
Diamond Ring, or Exchange no Robbery.’ It is said to be by
Mr. Theodore Hook. We should not wonder. The morality, and
the sentiment are very flat, and very offensive; we mean, all the half
platonic, half serious love scenes between Sir Lennox Leinster, (Mr.
Conner), and Lady Cranberry (Mrs. Mardyn). This actress,—young,
handsome, and full of spirit as she is, and as the character she
represents is supposed to be,—and married to an old husband, who is
always grumbling, and complaining,—does not appear fitted to be
engaged in half an amour; nor as if she would excuse Sir Lennox
for being ‘figurative,’ in that way. Her conduct is at least equivocal,
and without any ostensible motive but a gross one, which yet she does
not acknowledge to herself. A Milan commission would inevitably
have ruined her, even though Sir Lennox had been a less likely man
than a well-looking, impudent, Irish Baronet. His personal pretensions
are certainly formidable to her jealous spouse (Mr. Terry,
an Adonis of sixty)—though it is hard to find out the charms in his
conversation that recommend him so powerfully to the friendship of
the lady. He has one joke, one flower of rhetoric, interspersed
through all his discourse, witty or amorous—the cant phrase, ‘You’ll
excuse my being figurative.’ His metaphorical turn would not
however have been excused, but for the matter-of-fact notions and
accomplishments of Mr. Liston—who plays a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> pot boy in the
comic group, the supposed son of old Cranberry, but the real and
proper off-spring of old Swipes, the landlord of The Pig and
Gridiron. This hopeful young gentleman has been palmed upon his
pretended father, (to the no small mortification and dismay of both
parties) instead of the intrepid Lieutenant Littleworth (Mr. Barnard)
the true heir to the Cranberry estate and honours. Liston, as young
Swipes, has nothing genteel about him; not even the wish to be so.
His inclinations are low. Thus he likes to drink with the butler;
makes a young blackamore, whom he calls ‘snowdrop,’ drunk with
claret, and is in love with Miss Polly Watts, who has red hair, a red
face, and red elbows. He has vowed to elope with her before that
day week, and make her Mrs. C., and would no doubt have been as
good as his word if the secret of his birth had not been discovered by
his mother-in-law, in revenge for a matrimonial squabble; and the
whole ends, as a three-act piece should do—abruptly but agreeably.
Mr. Liston’s acting in such a character as we have described, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>needless to add, was infinitely droll, and Terry was a father worthy
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tempore</span></i>) of such a son.</p>

<p class='c028'>The Manager of the English Opera House on Monday, 21st ult.
brought out an occasional farce against the Manager of Drury-Lane,
called Patent Seasons; deprecating the encroachments of the winter
theatres, and predicting that, in consequence, ‘the English Opera
would soon be a Beggar’s Opera.’ His hits at his overbearing rival
were good, and <i>told</i>; but the confession of the weakness and ‘poverty,’
which Mr. Elliston had thrown in his teeth, rather served to damp
than excite the enthusiasm of the audience. Every one is inclined to
run away from a falling house; and of all appeals, that to humanity
should be the last. The town may be bullied, ridiculed, wheedled,
<i>puffed</i> out of their time and money, but to ask them to sink their
patronage in a bankrupt concern, is to betray an ignorance of the
world, who sympathise with the prosperous, and laugh at injustice.
Generosity is the last infirmity of the public mind. Pity is a frail
ground of popularity: and ‘misery doth part the flux of company.’
If you want the assistance of others, put a good face upon the matter,
and conceal it from them that you want it. Do not whine and look
piteous in their faces, or they will treat you like a dog. The 170
families that Mr. Arnold tells us depend upon his minor theatre for
support are not ‘Russian sufferers,’ nor sufferers in a triumphant
cause. Talk of 170 distressed families dependent on a distressed
manager (not an autocrat of one vast theatre) and the sound hangs
like a mill-stone on the imagination, ‘or load to sink a navy.’ The
audience slink away, one by one, willing to slip their necks out of it.
<i>Charity is cold.</i></p>

<p class='c021'>The Manager of the English Opera House, however, does not
stand alone in his difficulties. The theatres in general seem to totter,
and feel the hand of decay. Even the King’s Theatre, we understand,
has manifested signs of decrepitude, and ‘palsied eld,’ and
stopped,—we do not say its payments, but its performances. Of all
the theatres, we should feel the least compassion for the deserted
saloons and tattered hangings of the Italian Opera. We should rather
indeed see it flourish, as it has long flourished, in splendour and in
honour: we do not like ‘to see a void made in the Drama: any ruin
on the face of the land.’ But this would touch us the least. We
might be disposed to write its epitaph, not its elegy.</p>

<p class='c021'>Why was not this No. <span class='fss'>XII.</span> instead of No. <span class='fss'>XI.</span> of the Acted
Drama in London? Had we but seen No. <span class='fss'>XII.</span> at the head of our
article for December, we had been happy, ‘as broad and casing as
the general air, whole as the marble, founded as the rock,’ but now
we are ‘cooped and cabined in by saucy doubts and fears.’ Had
No. <span class='fss'>XI.</span> been ready in time, we should have been irreproachable ‘in
act and complement extern,’ which is with us every thing. Punctuality
is ‘the immediate jewel of our souls.’ We leave it to others to
be shrewd, ingenious, witty and wise; to think deeply, and write
finely; it is enough for us to be exactly dull. The categories of
<i>number</i> and <i>quantity</i> are what we chiefly delight in; for on these
depend (by arithmetical computation) the pounds, shillings, and pence.
We suspect that those writers only trouble their heads about fame,
who cannot get any thing more substantial for what they write; and
are in fact equally at a loss for ‘solid pudding or for empty praise.’
That is not the case with us. We have money in our purse, and
reputation—to spare. Nothing troubles us but that our article on the
drama was wanting for November—on this point we are inconsolable.
No more delight in regularity—no more undisturbed complacency in
the sense of arduous duty conscientiously discharged—no more confidence
in meeting our Editors—no more implicit expectation of our
monthly decisions on the part of the public! As the Italian poet for
one error of the press, in a poem presented to the Pope, died of
chagrin, so we for one deficiency in this series of Dramatic Criticisms
(complete but for that) must resign! We have no other way left to
appease our scrupulous sense of critical punctilio. That there was but
one link wanting, is no matter—</p>

<p class='c022'>There was one Number (the eleventh) of the <span class='sc'>London Magazine</span>, of
which the curious reader turned over the pages with eager haste, and
found no Drama—a thing never to be remedied! It was no fault of
ours that it was so. A friend hath done this. The author of
the Calendar of Nature (a pleasing and punctual performance) has
spoiled our Calendar of Art, and robbed us of that golden rigol of
periodical praise, that we had in fancy ‘bound our brows withal.’
With the month our contribution to the stock of literary amusement
and scientific intelligence returned without fail. In January, we gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>an account of all the actors we had ever seen or heard of. In
February, we confined ourselves to Miss O’Neill. In March, we
expatiated at large on the Minor Theatres, and took great delight in
the three Miss Dennetts. In April (being at Ilminster, a pretty
town in the Vale of Taunton, and thence passing on to the Lamb at
Hindon, a dreary spot), we proved at these two places, sitting in an
arm-chair by a sea-coal fire, very satisfactorily, and without fear of
contradiction,—neither Mr. Maturin, Mr. Shiel, nor Mr. Milman
being present,—that no modern author could write a tragedy. In
May, we wrote an article which filled the proper number of columns,
though we forget what it was about. In June, we had to show that
a modern author had written a tragedy (Virginius)—an opinion,
which, though it overset our theory, we are by no means desirous to
retract. We still say, that that play is better than Bertram, though
Mr. Maturin, in the Preface to Melmoth, says it is not. As in June
we were not dry, neither in July were we droughty. We found
something to say in this and the following month without being much
indebted to the actors or actresses, though, if Miss Tree came out in
either of those months, we ought to recollect it, and mark the event
with <i>a white stone</i>. We had rather hear her sing in ordinary cases
than Miss Stephens, though not in extraordinary ones. By the bye,
when will that little pouting<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c015'><sup>[46]</sup></a> slut, with crystalline eyes and voice,
return to us from the sister island? The Dublin critics hardly
pretend to keep her to themselves, on the ground that they (like the
Edinburgh wags) are better judges and patrons of merit, than we of
famous London town.—The Irish are impudent: but they are not so
impudent as the Scotch. This is a digression. To proceed.—In
August, we had a skirmish with the facetious and biting Janus, of
versatile memory, on his assumed superiority in dramatic taste and
skill, when we corrected him for his contempt of court—and the Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>Dennetts, our wards in criticism. In September, we got an able
article written for us; for we flatter ourselves, that we not only say
good things ourselves, but are the cause of them in others. In
October, we called Mr. Elliston to task for taking, in his vocation of
manager, improper liberties with the public. But in November, (may
that dark month stand aye accursed in the Calendar!) we failed, and
failed, as how? Our friend, the ingenious writer aforesaid (one of
the most ingenious and sharp-witted men of his age, but not so
remarkable for the virtue of <i>reliability</i> as Mr. Coleridge’s friend, the
poet-laureate), was to take a mutton-chop with us, and afterwards we
were to go to the play, and club our forces in a criticism—but he
never came, <i>we</i> never went to the play (The Stranger with Charles
Kemble as the hero, and a new Mrs. Haller), and the criticism was
never written. The Drama of the <span class='sc'>London Magazine</span> for that month
is left a blank!—We were in hopes that our other contributors might
have been proportionably on the alert; but, on the contrary, we were
sorry to hear it remarked by more than one person, that the Magazine
for November was, on the whole, dull. There was no <span class='sc'>Table-Talk</span>,
for instance, an article which we take up immediately after we have
perused our own, and seldom lay it down till we get to the end of it,
though we think the papers too long. We are glad to see the notice
from the redoubtable <span class='sc'>Lion’s Head</span> of No. <span class='fss'>V.</span> for the present Number,
for we understand that a Cockney, in clandestine correspondence
with Blackwood, on looking for it in the last, and finding it <i>missing</i>,
had sent off instant word, that the writer ‘was expelled’ from the
<span class='sc'>London Magazine</span>. We are sure we should be sorry for that.</p>

<p class='c021'>If theatrical criticisms were only written when there is something
worth writing about, it would be hard upon us who live by them.
Are we not to receive our quarter’s salary (like Mr. Croker in the
piping time of peace) because Mrs. Siddons has left the stage, and
‘has not left her peer;’ or because John Kemble will not return to
it with renewed health and vigour, to prop a falling house, and
falling art; or because Mr. Kean has gone to America; or because
Mr. Wallack has arrived from that country? No; the duller the
stage grows, the gayer and more edifying must we become in ourselves:
the less we have to say about that, the more room we have to
talk about other things. Now would be the time for Mr. Coleridge
to turn his talents to account, and write for the stage, when there is
no topic to confine his pen, or, ‘constrain his genius by mastery.’
‘With mighty wings outspread, his imagination might brood over the
void and make it pregnant.’ Under the assumed head of the Drama,
he might unfold the whole mysteries of Swedenborg, or ascend the
third heaven of invention with Jacob Behmen: he might write a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>treatise on all the unknown sciences, and finish the Encyclopedia
Metropolitana in a pocket form:—nay, he might bring to a satisfactory
close his own dissertation on the difference between the Imagination
and the Fancy,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c015'><sup>[47]</sup></a> before, in all probability, another great actor
appears, or another tragedy or comedy is written. He is the man of
all others to swim on empty bladders in a sea, without shore or
soundings: to drive an empty stage-coach without passengers or
lading, and arrive behind his time; to write marginal notes without a
text; to look into a millstone to foster the rising genius of the age;
to ‘see merit in the chaos of its elements, and discern perfection in
the great obscurity of nothing,’ as his most favourite author, Sir
Thomas Brown, has it on another occasion. Alas! we have no
such creative talents: we cannot amplify, expand, raise our flimsy
discourse, as the gaseous matter fills and lifts the round, glittering,
slow-sailing balloon, to ‘the up-turned eyes of wondering mortals.’
Here is our bill of fare for the month, our list of memoranda—<i>The
French dancers</i>—<i>Farren’s Deaf Lover</i>—<i>Macready’s Zanga</i>—<i>Mr.
Cooper’s Romeo</i>. <i>A new farce, not acted a second time—Wallace, a
tragedy,—<span class='fixed'>and</span> Mr. Wallack’s Hamlet.</i> Who can make any thing of
such a beggarly account as this? Not we. Yet as poets at a pinch
invoke the Muse, so we, for once, will invoke Mr. Coleridge’s better
genius, and thus we hear him talk, diverting our attention from the
players and the play.</p>

<p class='c021'>‘The French, my dear H——,’ would he begin, ‘are not a people
of imagination. They have so little, that you cannot persuade them
to conceive it possible that they have none. They have no poetry,
no such thing as genius, from the age of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> It was that,
their boasted Augustan age, which stamped them French, which put
the seal upon their character, and from that time nothing has grown
up original or luxuriant, or spontaneous among them; the whole has
been cast in a mould, and that a bad one. Montaigne and Rabelais
(their two greatest men, the one for thought, and the other for
imaginative humour,—for the distinction between imagination and
fancy holds in ludicrous as well as serious composition) I consider as
Franks rather than Frenchmen, for in their time the national literature
was not <i>set</i>, was neither mounted on stilts, nor buckramed in
stays. Wit they had too, if I could persuade myself that Moliere
was a genuine Frenchman, but I cannot help suspecting that his
mother played his reputed father false, and that an Englishman begot
him. I am sure his genius is English; and his wit not of the
Parisian cut. As a proof of this, see how his most extravagant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>farces, the Mock-doctor, Barnaby Brittle, &amp;c. take with us. What
can be more to the taste of our <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</span></i>, more adapted to our native
tooth, than his Country Wife, which Wycherly did little else than
translate into English? What success a translator of Racine into our
vernacular tongue would meet with, I leave you to guess. His
tragedies are not poetry, are not passion, are not imagination: they
are a parcel of set speeches, of epigrammatic conceits, of declamatory
phrases, without any of the glow, and glancing rapidity, and principle
of fusion in the mind of the poet, to agglomerate them into grandeur,
or blend them into harmony. The principle of the imagination
resembles the emblem of the serpent, by which the ancients typified
wisdom and the universe, with undulating folds, for ever varying and
for ever flowing into itself,—circular, and without beginning or end.
The definite, the fixed, is death: the principle of life is the indefinite,
the growing, the moving, the continuous. But every thing in French
poetry is cut up into shreds and patches, little flowers of poetry, with
tickets and labels to them, as when the daughters of Jason minced
and hacked their old father into collops—we have the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">disjecta membra
poetæ</span></i>—not the entire and living man. The spirit of genuine poetry
should inform the whole work, should breathe through, and move,
and agitate the complete mass, as the soul informs and moves the
limbs of a man, or as the vital principle (whatever it be) permeates
the veins of the loftiest trees, building up the trunk, and extending
the branches to the sun and winds of heaven, and shooting out into
fruit and flowers. This is the progress of nature and of genius. This
is the true poetic faculty; or that which the Greeks literally called
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ποιησις</span>. But a French play (I think it is Schlegel, who somewhere
makes the comparison, though I had myself, before I ever read
Schlegel, made the same remark) is like a child’s garden set with
slips of branches and flowers, stuck in the ground, not growing in it.
We may weave a gaudy garland in this manner, but it withers in an
hour: while the products of genius and nature give out their odours
to the gale, and spread their tints in the sun’s eye, age after age—</p>

<p class='c022'>and flourish in immortal youth and beauty. Every thing French is,
in the way of it, frittered into parts: every thing is therefore dead
and ineffective. French poetry is just like chopped logic: nothing
comes of it. There is no life of mind: neither the birth nor generation
of knowledge. It is all patch-work, all sharp points and angles,
all superficial. They receive, and give out sensation, too readily for
it ever to amount to a sentiment. They cannot even dance, as you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>may see. There is, I am sure you will agree, no expression, no
grace in their dancing. Littleness, point, is what damns them in all
they do. With all their vivacity, and animal spirits, they dance not
like men and women under the impression of certain emotions, but
like puppets; they twirl round like <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tourniquets</span></i>. Not to feel, and not
to think, is all they know of this art or any other. You might swear
that a nation that danced in that manner would never produce a true
poet or philosopher. They have it not in them. There is not the
principle of cause and effect. They make a sudden turn because
there is no reason for it: they stop short, or move fast, only because
you expect something else. Their style of dancing is difficult:
would it were impossible.’<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c015'><sup>[48]</sup></a> (By this time several persons in the pit
had turned round to listen to this uninterrupted discourse, and our
eloquent friend went on, rather raising his voice with a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paulo majora
canamus</span></i>.) ‘Look at that Mademoiselle Milanie with “the foot of
fire,” as she is called. You might contrive a paste-board figure, with
the help of strings or wires, to do all, and more, than she does—to
point the toe, to raise the leg, to jerk the body, to run like wild-fire.
Antics are not grace: to dance is not to move against time. My
dear H——, if you could see a dance by some Italian peasant-girls
in the Campagna of Rome, as I have, I am sure your good taste
and good sense would approve it. They came forward slow and
smiling, but as if their limbs were steeped in luxury, and every
motion seemed an echo of the music, and the heavens looked on
serener as they trod. You are right about the Miss Dennetts, though
you have all the cant-phrases against you. It is true, they break
down in some of their steps, but it is like “the lily drooping on its
stalk green,” or like “the flowers Proserpina let fall from Dis’s
waggon.” Those who cannot see grace in the youth and inexperience
of these charming girls, would see no beauty in a cluster of
hyacinths, bent with the morning dew. To shew at once what is,
and is not French, there is Mademoiselle Hullin, she is Dutch.
Nay, she is just like a Dutch doll, as round-faced, as rosy, and looks
for all the world as if her limbs were made of wax-work, and would
take in pieces, but not as if she could move them of her own accord.
Alas, poor tender thing! As to the men, I confess’ (this was said
to me in an audible whisper, lest it might be construed into a breach
of confidence) ‘I should like, as Southey says, to have them <i>hamstrung</i>!’—(At
this moment Monsieur Hullin <i>Pere</i> looked as if this
charitable operation was about to be performed on him by an extra-official
warrant from the poet-laureate.)</p>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>‘Pray, H——, have you seen Macready’s Zanga?’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘And what do you think of it?’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘I did not like it much.’</p>

<p class='c021'>‘Nor I.—Macready has talents and a magnificent voice, but he is,
I fear, too improving an actor to be a man of genius. That little
ill-looking vagabond Kean never improved in any thing. In some
things he could not, and in others he would not. The only parts of
M.’s Zanga that I liked (which of course I only half-liked) were
some things in imitation of the <i>extremely natural manner</i> of Kean,
and his address to Alonzo, urging him, as the greatest triumph of his
self-denial, to sacrifice</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>where his voice rose exulting on the sentiment, like the thunder that
clothes the neck of the war-horse. The person that pleased me most
in this play was Mrs. Sterling: she did justice to her part—a thing
not easy to do. I like Macready’s Wallace better than his Zanga,
though the play is not a good one, and it is difficult for the actor to
find out the author’s meaning. I would not judge harshly of a first
attempt, but the faults of youthful genius are exuberance, and a continual
desire of novelty: now the faults of this play are tameness,
common-place, and clap-traps. It is said to be written by young
Walker, the son of the Westminster orator. If so, his friend,
Mr. Cobbett, will probably write a Theatrical Examiner of it in his
next week’s Political Register. What, I would ask, can be worse,
more out of character and costume, than to make Wallace drop his
sword to have his throat cut by Menteith, merely because the latter
has proved himself (what he suspected) a traitor and a villain, and
then console himself for this voluntary martyrdom by a sentimental
farewell to the rocks and mountains of his native country! This
effeminate softness and wretched cant did not belong to the age, the
country, or the hero. In this scene, however, Mr. Macready shone
much; and in the attitude in which he stood after letting his sword
fall, he displayed extreme grace and feeling. It was as if he had let
his best friend, his trusty sword, drop like a serpent from his hand.
Macready’s figure is awkward, but his attitudes are graceful and well
composed.—Don’t you think so?’—</p>

<p class='c021'>I answered, yes; and he then ran on in his usual manner, by
inquiring into the metaphysical distinction between the grace of form,
and the grace that arises from motion (as for instance, you may move
a square form in a circular or waving line), and illustrated this subtle
observation at great length and with much happiness. He asked me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>how it was, that Mr. Farren in the farce of the Deaf Lover, played
the old gentleman so well, and failed so entirely in the young gallant.
I said I could not tell. He then tried at a solution himself, in which
I could not follow him so as to give the precise point of his argument.
He afterwards defined to me, and those about us, the merits of
Mr. Cooper and Mr. Wallack, classing the first as a respectable, and
the last as a second-rate actor; with large grounds and learned definitions
of his meaning on both points; and, as the lights were by this
time nearly out, and the audience (except his immediate auditors)
going away, he reluctantly ‘ended,’</p>

<h3 class='c008'>LECTURES ON THE ENGLISH COMIC WRITERS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c024'>These Lectures were delivered at the Surrey Institution, in Blackfriars Road, in
1818, after the completion of the course on the English Poets (see vol. <span class='fss'>V.</span>). Some
particulars as to their delivery will be found in Talfourd’s edition of Lamb’s <cite>Letters</cite>
(see Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s reprint, Bohn, i. 38 <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>), and in Patmore’s <cite>My Friends
and Acquaintance</cite>. See also Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s <cite>Four Generations of a Literary
Family</cite> (vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span> pp. 121-2), where the opinions of Beckford and Thackeray are
referred to. In the third edition of the Lectures (see Bibliographical Note) several
passages ‘collected by the author, apparently with a view to a reprint of the
volume,’ were interpolated. Two of these passages are taken from a long letter
(published in full in the Appendix to these notes) which Hazlitt contributed to
<cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite>, Oct. 15, 1813. The rest are taken from prefatory notices
which he contributed to William Oxberry’s <cite>The New English Drama</cite> (20 vols.
1818-1825), and are printed in the following notes.</p>

    dress, gesture, etc., which becoming obsolete, and being in themselves altogether

    <dd><i>An act which realises the parable of the good Samaritan.</i> Sergeant Talfourd, in his
    account of these Lectures, speaks of the insensibility of the bulk of the audience, and
    adds: ‘He [Hazlitt] once had a more edifying advantage over them. He was enumerating the
    humanities which endeared Dr. Johnson to his mind, and at the close of an agreeable
    catalogue mentioned as last and noblest “his carrying the poor victim of disease and
    dissipation on his back through Fleet Street,” at which a titter arose from some who were
    struck by the picture as ludicrous, and a murmur from others who deemed the allusion
    unfit for ears polite: he paused for an instant, and then added, in his sturdiest and
    most impressive manner—“an act which realizes the <span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>parable of the Good
    Samaritan”—at which his moral, and his delicate hearers shrank, rebuked, into deep

    <dd>In the third edition the following account of <cite>The Busy Body</cite>, taken from
    Oxberry’s <cite>The New English Drama</cite> (Vol. <span class='fss'>VI.</span>) is
    inserted:
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘“The Busy Body” is a comedy that has now held possession of the stage above a hundred
    years (the best test of excellence); and the merit that has enabled it to do so, consists
    in the ingenuity of the contrivance, the liveliness of the plot, and the striking effect
    of the situations. Mrs. Centlivre, in this and her other plays, could do nothing without
    a stratagem; but she could do everything with one. She delights in putting her
    <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i> continually at their wit’s end, and in helping them off
    with a new evasion; and the subtlety of her resources is in proportion to <span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>the
    criticalness of the situation and the shortness of the notice for resorting to an
    expedient. Twenty times, in seeing or reading one of her plays, your pulse beats quick,
    and you become restless and apprehensive for the event; but with a fine theatrical
    sleight of hand, she lets you off, undoes the knot of the difficulty, and you breathe
    freely again, and have a hearty laugh into the bargain. In short, with her knowledge of
    chambermaids’ tricks, and insight into the intricate foldings of lovers’ hearts, she
    plays with the events of comedy, as a juggler shuffles about a pack of cards, to serve
    his own purposes, and to the surprise of the spectator. This is one of the most
    delightful employments of the dramatic art. It costs nothing—but a voluntary tax on the
    inventive powers of the author; and it produces, when successfully done, profit and
    praise to one party, and pleasure to all. To show the extent and importance of theatrical
    amusements (which some grave persons would decry altogether, and which no one can extol
    too highly), a friend of ours,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[49]</sup></a> whose name will be as well known to posterity as it is to his
    contemporaries, was not long ago mentioning, that one of the earliest and most memorable
    impressions ever made on his mind, was the seeing “Venice Preserved” acted in a country
    town when he was only nine years old. But he added, that an elderly lady who took him to
    see it, lamented, notwithstanding the wonder and delight he had experienced, that instead
    of “Venice Preserved,” they had not gone to see “The Busy Body,” which had been acted the
    night before. This was fifty years ago, since which, and for fifty years before that, it
    has been acted a thousand times in town and country, giving delight to the old, the
    young, and middle-aged, passing the time carelessly, and affording matter for agreeable
    reflection afterwards, making us think ourselves, and wish to be thought, the men equal
    to Sir George Airy in grace and spirit, the women to Miranda and Isabinda in love and
    beauty, and all of us superior to Marplot in wit. Among the scenes that might be
    mentioned in this comedy, as striking instances of happy stage effect, are Miranda’s
    contrivance to escape from Sir George, by making him turn his back upon her to hear her
    confession of love, and the ludicrous attitude in which he is left waiting for the rest
    of her speech after the lady has vanished; his offer of the hundred pounds to her
    guardian to make love to her in his presence, and when she receives him in dumb show, his
    answering for both; his situation concealed behind the chimney-screen; his supposed
    metamorphosis into a monkey, and his deliverance from thence in that character by the
    interference of Marplot; Mrs. Patch’s sudden conversion of the mysterious love letter
    into a charm for the toothache, and the whole of Marplot’s meddling and blunders. The
    last character is taken from Dryden and the Duchess of Newcastle; and is, indeed, the
    only attempt at character in the play. It is amusing and superficial. We see little of
    the puzzled perplexity of his brain, but his actions are absurd enough. He whiffles about
    the stage with considerable volubility, and makes a very lively automaton. Sir George
    Airy sets out for a scene or two in a spirited manner, but afterwards the character
    evaporates in the name; and he becomes as commonplace as his friend Charles, who merely
    laments over his misfortunes, or gets out of them by following the suggestions of his
    valet or his valet’s mistress. Miranda is the heroine of the piece, and has a right to be
    so; for she is a beauty and an heiress. Her friend has less to recommend her; but
    who <span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>can refuse to fall in love with her name? What volumes of sighs, what a
    world of love, is breathed in the very sound alone—the letters that form the charming
    name of Isabinda.’

    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘Colman, the elder, was the translator of Terence: and the “Jealous Wife” is a classical
    play. The plot is regular, the characters well supported, and the moral the best in the
    world. The dialogue has more sense than wit. The ludicrous arises from the skilful
    development of the characters, and the absurdities they commit in their own persons,
    rather than from the smart reflections which are made upon them by others. Thus nothing
    can be more ridiculous or more instructive than the scenes of which Mrs. Oakly is the
    heroine, yet they are all serious and unconscious: she exposes herself to our contempt
    and ridicule by the part she acts, by the airs she gives herself, and the fantastic
    behaviour in the situations in which she is placed. In other words, the character is pure
    comedy, not satire. Congreve’s comedies for the most part are satires, in which, from an
    exuberance of wit, the different speakers play off the sharp-pointed raillery on one
    another’s foibles, real or supposed. The best and most genuine kind of comedy, because
    the most dramatic, is that of character or humour, in which the persons introduced upon
    the stage are left to betray their own folly by their words and actions. The progressive
    winding up of the story of the present comedy is excellently managed. The jealousy and
    hysteric violence of Mrs. Oakly increase every moment, as the pretext for them becomes
    more and more frivolous. The attention is kept alive by our doubts about Oakly’s wavering
    (but in the end triumphant) firmness; and the arch insinuations and well-concerted
    home-thrusts of the Major heighten the comic interest of the scene. There is only one
    circumstance on which this veteran bachelor’s freedom of speech might have thrown a
    little more light, namely, that the married lady’s jealousy is in truth only a pretence
    for the exercise of her domineering spirit in general; so that we are left at last in
    some uncertainty as to the turn which this humour may take, and as to the future repose
    of her husband, though the affair of Miss Russet is satisfactorily cleared up. The
    under-plot of the two lovers is very ingeniously fitted into the principal one, and is
    not without interest in itself. Charles Oakly is a spirited, well-meaning, thoughtless
    young fellow, and Harriet Russet is an amiable romantic girl, in that very common, but
    always romantic situation—in love. Her persecution from the addresses of Lord Trinket and
    Sir Harry Beagle fans the gentle flame which had been kindled just a year before in her
    breast, produces the adventures and cross-purposes of the plot, and at last reconciles
    her to, and throws her into the arms of her lover, in spite of her resentment for his
    misconduct and apparent want of delicacy. The figure which Lord Trinket and Lady Freelove
    make in the piece is as odious and contemptible as it is possible for people in that
    class of life (and for no others) to make. The insolence, the meanness, the affectation,
    the hollowness, the want of humanity, sincerity, principle, and delicacy, are such as can
    only be found where artificial rank and station in society supersede not merely a regard
    to propriety of conduct, but the necessity even of an attention to appearances. The
    morality of the stage has (we are ready to hope) told in that direction as well as
    others, has, in some measure suppressed the suffocating pretensions and flaunting
    affectation of vice and folly in “persons of honour,” and, as it were, humanised rank and
    file. The pictures drawn of the finished depravity of such characters in high life, in
    the old comedies and novels, can hardly have been thrown away upon <span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>the persons
    themselves, any more than upon the world at large. Little Terence O’Cutler, the delicious
    <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span></i> of Lord Trinket and Lady Freelove, is a fit instrument for them to
    use, and follows in the train of such principals as naturally and assuredly as their
    shadow. Sir Harry Beagle is a coarse, but striking character of a thorough-bred
    fox-hunting country squire. He has but one idea in his head, but one sentiment in his
    heart—and that is his stud. This idea haunts his imagination, tinges or imbues every
    other object, and accounts for his whole phraseology, appearance, costume, and conduct.
    Sir Harry’s ruling passion is varied very ingeniously, and often turned to a very
    ludicrous account. There is a necessary monotony in the humour, which arises from a want
    of more than one idea, but the obviousness of the jest almost makes up for the recurrence
    of it; if the means of exciting mirth are mechanical, the effect is sure; and to say that
    a hearty laugh is cheaply purchased, is not a serious objection against it. When an
    author is terribly conscious of plagiarism, he seldom confesses it; when the obligation
    does not press his conscience, he sometimes does. Colman, in the advertisement to the
    first edition of the “Jealous Wife,” apologises for the freedom which he has used in
    borrowing from “Tom Jones.” In reading this modest excuse, though we have seen the play
    several times, we could not imagine what part of the plot was taken from Fielding. We did
    not suspect that Miss Russet was Sophia Western, and that old Russet and Sir Harry Beagle
    between them somehow represented Squire Western and young Blifil. But so it is! The
    outline of the plot and some of the characters are certainly the same, but the filling up
    destroys the likeness. There is all in the novel that there is in the play, but there is
    so much in the novel that is not in the play, that the total impression is quite
    different, and loses even an appearance of resemblance. In the same manner, though a
    profile or a shade of a face is exactly the same as the original, we with difficulty
    recognise it from the absence of so many other particulars. Colman might have kept his
    own secret, and no one would have been the wiser for it.’

    inserted:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘It, however, bears the stamp of the author’s genius, which was an indefinable mixture of
    the original and imitative. His plot, characters, and incidents are all apparently new;
    and yet, when you come to look into them, they are all old, with little variation or
    disguise: that is, the author sedulously avoided the beaten, vulgar path, and sought for
    singularity, but found it rather in the unhackneyed and eccentric inventions of those who
    had gone before him, than in his own stores. The “Vicar of Wakefield,” which abounds more
    than any of his works in delightful and original traits, is still very much borrowed, in
    its general tone and outline, from Fielding’s “Joseph Andrews.” Again, the characters and
    adventures of Tony Lumpkin, and the ridiculous conduct of his mother, in the present
    comedy, are a counterpart (even to the incident of the theft of the jewels) of those of
    the Widow Blackacre and her booby son in Wycherley’s “Plain Dealer.”
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd><span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>‘This sort of plagiarism, which gives us a repetition of new and striking pictures
    of human life, is much to be preferred to the dull routine of trite, vapid, every-day
    common-places; but it is more dangerous, as the stealing of pictures or family plate,
    where the property can be immediately identified, is more liable to detection than the
    stealing of bank-notes, or the current coin of the realm. Dr. Johnson’s sarcasm against
    some writer, that his “singularity was not his excellence,” cannot be applied to
    Goldsmith’s writings in general; but we are not sure whether it might not in severity be
    applied to “She Stoops to Conquer.” The incidents and characters are many of them
    exceedingly amusing; but they are so, a little at the expense of probability and
    <i>bienseance</i>. Tony Lumpkin is a very essential and unquestionably comic personage;
    but certainly his absurdities or his humours fail of none of their effect for want of
    being carried far enough. He is in his own sex what a hoyden is in the other. He is that
    vulgar nickname, a <i>hobbety-hoy</i>, dramatised; forward and sheepish, mischievous and
    idle, cunning and stupid, with the vices of the man and the follies of the boy; fond of
    low company, and giving himself all the airs of consequence of the young squire. His
    vacant delight in playing at cup and ball, and his impenetrable confusion and obstinate
    gravity in spelling the letter, drew fresh beauties from Mr. Liston’s face. Young
    Marlow’s bashfulness in the scenes with his mistress is, when well acted, irresistibly
    ludicrous; but still nothing can quite overcome our incredulity as to the existence of
    such a character in the present day, and in the rank of life, and with the education
    which Marlow is supposed to have had. It is a highly amusing caricature, a ridiculous
    fancy, but no more. One of the finest and most delicate touches of character is in the
    transition from the modest gentleman’s manner with his mistress, to the easy and
    agreeable tone of familiarity with the supposed chambermaid, which was not total and
    abrupt, but exactly such in kind and degree as such a character of natural reserve and
    constitutional timidity would undergo from the change of circumstances. Of the other
    characters in the piece, the most amusing are Tony Lumpkin’s associates at the Three
    Pigeons; and of these we profess the greatest partiality for the important showman who
    declares that “his bear dances to none but the genteelest of tunes, ‘Water parted from
    the Sea,’ or the minuet in ‘Ariadne’!”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50'

    from Oxberry’s <cite>The New English Drama</cite> (Vol. <span class='fss'>I.</span>) is
    inserted here:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘The “Rivals” is one of the most agreeable comedies we have. In the elegance and
    brilliancy of the dialogue, in a certain animation of moral sentiment, and in the
    masterly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span></i> of the fable, the “School for Scandal” is superior; but
    the “Rivals” has more life and action in it, and abounds in a greater number of whimsical
    characters, unexpected incidents, and absurd contrasts of situation. The effect of the
    “School for Scandal” is something like reading a collection of epigrams, that of the
    “Rivals” is more like reading a novel. In the first you are always at the toilette or in
    the drawing-room; in the last you pass into the open air, and take a turn in King’s Mead.
    The interest is kept alive in the one play by smart repartees, in the other by startling
    rencontres: in the one we laugh at the satirical descriptions of the speakers, in the
    other the situation of their persons on the stage is irresistibly ludicrous. Thus the
    interviews between Lucy and Sir Lucius O’Trigger, between Acres and his friend Jack, who
    is at once his confidant and his rival; between Mrs. Malaprop and the lover of her niece
    as Captain Absolute, and between the young lady and the same person as the pretended
    Ensign Beverley, tell from the mere <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">double entendre</span></i> of the scene, and from
    the ignorance of the parties of one another’s persons and designs. There is no source of
    dramatic effect more complete than this species of practical satire (in which our author
    seems to have been an adept), where one character in the piece is made a fool of and
    turned into ridicule to his face, by the very person whom he is trying to over-reach.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘There is scarcely a more delightful play than the “Rivals” when it is well acted, or one
    that goes off more indifferently when it is not. The humour is of so broad and farcical a
    kind, that if not thoroughly entered into and carried off by the tone and manner of the
    performers, it fails of effect from its obtrusiveness, and becomes flat from
    eccentricity. The absurdities brought forward are of that artificial, affected, and
    preposterous description, that we in some measure require to have the evidence of our
    senses to see the persons themselves “jetting under the advance plumes of their folly,”<a
    id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c015'><sup>[52]</sup></a> before we
    can entirely believe in their existence, or derive pleasure from their exposure. If the
    extravagance of the poet’s conception is not supported by the downright reality of the
    representation, our credulity is staggered and falls to the ground.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘For instance, Acres should be as odd a compound in external appearance as he is of the
    author’s brain. He must look like a very notable mixture of the lively coxcomb and the
    blundering blockhead, to reconcile us to his continued impertinence and senseless
    flippancy. Acres is a mere conventional character, a gay, fluttering automaton,
    constructed upon mechanical principles, and pushed, as it were, by the logic of wit and a
    strict keeping in the pursuit of the ridiculous, into follies and fopperies which his
    natural thoughtlessness would never have dreamt of. Acres does not say or do what such a
    half-witted young gentleman would say or do of his own head, but what he might be led to
    do or say with such a prompter as Sheridan at his elbow to tutor him in absurdity—to make
    a butt of him first, and laugh at him afterwards. Thus his presence of mind in persisting
    in his allegorical swearing, “Odds triggers and flints,”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53'
    class='c015'><sup>[53]</sup></a> in the duel scene, when he is
    trembling all over with cowardice, is quite out of character, but it keeps up the
    preconcerted jest. In proportion, therefore, as the author has overdone <span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>the
    part, it calls for a greater effort of animal spirits, and a peculiar aptitude of genius
    in the actor to go through with it, to humour the extravagance, and to seem to take a
    real and cordial delight in caricaturing himself. Dodd<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54'
    class='c015'><sup>[54]</sup></a> was the only actor we remember who
    realised this ideal combination of volatility and phlegm, of slowness of understanding
    with levity of purpose, of vacancy of thought and vivacity of gesture. Acres’ affected
    phrases and apish manners used to sit upon this inimitable actor with the same sort of
    bumpkin grace and conscious self-complacency as the new cut of his clothes. In general,
    this character is made little of on the stage; and when left to shift for itself, seems
    as vapid as it is forced.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘Mrs. Malaprop is another portrait of the same overcharged description. The chief
    drollery of this extraordinary personage consists of her unaccountable and systematic
    misapplication of hard words. How she should know the words, and not their meaning, is a
    little odd. In reading the play we are amused with such a series of ridiculous blunders,
    just as we are with a series of puns or cross-readings. But to keep up the farce upon the
    stage, besides “a nice derangement of epitaphs,”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55'
    class='c015'><sup>[55]</sup></a> the imagination must have the
    assistance of a stately array of grave pretensions, and a most formidable establishment
    of countenance, with all the vulgar self-sufficiency of pride and ignorance, before it
    can give full credit to this learned tissue of technical absurdity.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘As to Miss Lydia Languish, she is not easily done to the life. She is a delightful
    compound of extravagance and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i>. She is fond and froward, practical and
    chimerical, hot and cold in a breath. She is that kind of fruit which drops into the
    mouth before it is ripe. She must have a husband, but she will not have one without an
    elopement. This young lady is at an age and of a disposition to throw herself into the
    arms of the first handsome young fellow she meets; but she repents and grows sullen, like
    a spoiled child, when she finds that nobody hinders her. She should have all the
    physiognomical marks of a true boarding-school, novel-reading Miss about her, and some
    others into the bargain. Sir Anthony’s description hardly comes up to the truth. She
    should have large, rolling eyes; pouting, disdainful lips; a pale, clear complexion; an
    oval chin, an arching neck, and a profusion of dark ringlets falling down upon it, or she
    will never answer to our ideas of the charming sentimental hoyden, who is the heroine of
    the play.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘Faulkland is a refined study of a very common disagreeable character, actuated by an
    unceasing spirit of contradiction, who perversely seizes every idle pretext for making
    himself and others miserable; or querulous enthusiast, determined on disappointment, and
    enamoured with suspicion. He is without excuse; nor is it without some difficulty that we
    endure his self-tormenting follies, through our partiality for Julia, the amiable,
    unresisting victim of his gloomy caprice.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘Sir Anthony Absolute and his son are the most sterling characters of the play. The
    tetchy, positive, impatient, overbearing, but warm and generous character of the one, and
    the gallant, determined spirit, adroit address, and dry humour of the other, are
    admirably set off against each other. The two scenes in which they contend about the
    proposed match, in the first of which the indignant lover is as choleric and rash as the
    old gentleman is furious and obstinate, and in the latter of which the son affects such a
    cool indifference and dutiful submission to his father, from having found out that it is
    the mistress of his choice whom he is to be compelled to marry, <span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>are
    masterpieces both of wit, humour, and character. Sir Anthony Absolute is an evident copy
    after Smollett’s kind-hearted, high-spirited Matthew Bramble, as Mrs. Malaprop is after
    the redoubted linguist, Mrs. Tabitha Bramble; and, indeed the whole tone, as well as the
    local scenery of the “Rivals,” reminds the reader of “Humphry Clinker.” Sheridan had a
    right to borrow; and he made use of this privilege, not sparingly, both in this and in
    his other plays. His Acres, as well in the general character as in particular scenes, is
    a <i>mannered</i> imitation of Sir Andrew Ague-cheek.

    “Rivals,” are not the less amusing on that account. Fag wears his master’s wit, as he
    does his lace, at second-hand; Lucy is an edifying specimen of simplicity in a
    chambermaid, and Sir Lucius is an honest fortune-hunting Hibernian, who means well to
    himself, and no harm to anybody else. They are also traditional characters, common to the
    stage; but they are drawn with all the life and spirit of originals.

    <dd>‘This appears, indeed, to have been the peculiar <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</span></i> and the great praise
    of our author’s genius, that he could imitate with the spirit of an inventor. There is
    hardly a character, we believe, or a marked situation in any of his works, of which there
    are not distinct traces to be found in his predecessors. But though the groundwork and
    texture of his materials was little more than what he found already existing in the
    models of acknowledged excellence, yet he constantly varied or improved upon their
    suggestions with masterly skill and ingenuity. He applied what he thus borrowed, with a
    sparkling effect and rare felicity, to different circumstances, and adapted it with
    peculiar elegance to the prevailing taste of the age. He was the farthest possible from a
    servile plagiarist. He wrote in imitation of Congreve, Vanbrugh, or Wycherley, as those
    persons would have written in continuation of themselves, had they lived at the same time
    with him. There is no excellence of former writers of which he has not availed himself,
    and which he has not converted to his own purposes, with equal spirit and success. He had
    great acuteness and knowledge of the world; and if he did not create his own characters,
    he compared them with their prototypes in nature, and understood their bearings and
    qualities, before he undertook to make a different use of them. He had wit, fancy,
    sentiment at command, enabling him to place the thoughts of others in new lights of his
    own, which reflected back an added lustre on the originals: whatever he touched, he
    adorned with all the ease, grace, and brilliancy of his style. If he ranks only as a man
    of second-rate genius, he was assuredly a man of first-rate talents. He was the most
    classical and the most popular dramatic writer of his age. The works he has left behind
    him will remain as monuments of his fame, for the delight and instruction of posterity.

    <dd>‘Mr. Sheridan not only excelled as a comic writer, but was also an eminent orator, and a
    disinterested patriot. As a public speaker, he was distinguished by acuteness of
    observation and pointed wit, more than by impassioned eloquence, or powerful and
    comprehensive reasoning. Considering him with reference to his conversational talents,
    his merits as a comic writer, and as a political character, he was perhaps the most
    accomplished person of his time.

    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘As to the “West Indian,” it is a play that from the time of its first appearing has
    continued to hold possession of the stage, with just enough merit to keep it there, and
    no striking faults to drive it thence. It is above mediocrity. There is an agreeable vein
    of good humour and animal spirits running through it that does not suffer it to sink into
    downright insipidity, nor ever excites any very high degree of interest or delight. Wit
    there is none, and hardly an attempt at humour, except in the character of Major O’
    Flaherty, who would not be recognised as a genuine Irishman but by virtue of his
    representative on the stage. His blunders and conduct are not such as would proceed from
    the good-natured unthinking impetuosity of such a person as O’ Flaherty is intended to
    be: but they are such as the author might sit down and try to invent for him. It is not
    an Irish character, but a character playing the Irishman; not a hasty, warm-hearted,
    hair-brained fellow, stumbling on mistakes by accident either in his words and actions,
    but a very complaisant gentleman, looking out for them by design, to humour the opinion
    which you entertain of him, and who is to make himself a national butt for the audience
    to laugh at. The “West Indian” himself (Belcour) is certainly the support of the piece.
    There is something interesting in the idea of seeing a young fellow of high animal
    spirits, a handsome fortune, and considerable generosity of feeling, launched from the
    other side of the world (with the additional impetus that the distance would give him) to
    run the gauntlet of the follies and vices of the town, to fall into scrapes only to get
    out of them, and who is full of professions of attachment to virtues which he does not
    practise, and of repentance for offences which he has not committed. It is the same
    character as Charles Surface in the “School for Scandal,” with an infusion of the
    romantic from his transatlantic origin, and an additional excuse for his extravagances in
    the tropical temperature of his blood.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘The language of this play is elegant but common-place: the speakers seem in general more
    intent on adjusting their periods than on settling their affairs. The sentiments aspire
    to liberality. They are amiably mawkish, and as often as they incline to paradox, have a
    rapid sort of petulance about them, which excites neither our sympathy nor our esteem.
    The plot is a good plot. It is well laid, decently distributed through the course of five
    acts, and wound up at last to its final catastrophe in a single sentence.’

<h3 class='c008'>A VIEW OF THE ENGLISH STAGE</h3>

<p class='c024'>In this work, published in 1818, Hazlitt collected the greater part of the
theatrical criticisms which he had contributed successively to <cite>The Morning
Chronicle</cite>, <cite>The Champion</cite>, <cite>The Examiner</cite>, and <cite>The Times</cite>. His first article in <cite>The
Morning Chronicle</cite> appeared on October 18, 1813 (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 192), and the last on
May 27, 1814 (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 195). In his essay, ‘On Patronage and Puffing’
(<cite>Table Talk</cite>, vol. <span class='fss'>V.</span> pp. 292, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>), Hazlitt gives an account of his theatrical
criticisms in the <cite>Chronicle</cite>. He thought himself that they were the best articles in
the series (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, p. 174), and they are at any rate of exceptional interest inasmuch
as they deal for the most part with the first appearances of Edmund Kean
in London. His first article in <cite>The Champion</cite>, then edited by John Scott, appeared
on August 14, 1814 (see p. 196), and the last on January 8, 1815 (see p. 208).
Early in 1815 he became the regular dramatic critic of <cite>The Examiner</cite>. Leigh
Hunt, the editor, had intended to resume theatrical criticism after his release from
prison in February, but his attention was diverted to politics by the return of
Buonaparte from Elba. Hazlitt’s first article (except for two notices of Kean’s
<i>Iago</i>, July 24 and August 7, 1814) appeared on March 19, 1815 (see p. 221), the
last on June 8, 1817 (see p. 373). By far the greater part of Hazlitt’s articles in
<cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite>, <cite>The Champion</cite>, and <cite>The Examiner</cite> were included by him in
<cite>A View of the English Stage</cite>. Some passages, however, and, we think, some articles,
he did omit (especially from <cite>The Examiner</cite> of 1817). In the following notes passages
omitted from articles included in <cite>A View</cite> are printed in full; articles omitted
from <cite>A View</cite> are shortly summarised, if it is pretty clear from internal evidence
that they were written by Hazlitt. Owing to want of space these articles cannot
be printed in the present volume, but those which are clearly Hazlitt’s will be
found among fugitive writings in a later volume, together with some notices
(deemed certainly his) from <cite>The Times</cite>. Hazlitt seems to have been the dramatic
critic, or one of the dramatic critics, of <cite>The Times</cite> from the summer of 1817 till
the spring of 1818, but only two of his articles (pp. 374, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>) were included
in <cite>A View of the English Stage</cite>. These appeared in September 1817, near the
beginning of his term of office. Hazlitt’s reason for including so few of his <cite>Times</cite>
articles is not known. An examination of the dramatic notices in <cite>The Times</cite> during
the period in question suggests (1) that there were at least two regular dramatic critics
on the staff, (2) that Hazlitt chiefly confined himself to Shakespearian and other
plays of established reputation, and (3) that he practically ceased to write at the
end of 1817. The following may be mentioned among the more important
articles, which may, with varying degrees of probability, be ascribed to Hazlitt:—
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span><cite>School for Scandal</cite> (Munden as Sir Peter Teazle), September 8, 1817; Young’s
Hamlet, September 9; <cite>As You Like It</cite> (Miss Brunton as Rosalind), September 20;

Hamlet, December 11; Kean’s Macbeth, December 16; <cite>King John</cite> (Miss O’Neill

    in the provinces. At Dorchester one of his performances had been witnessed by Arnold, the
    stage manager of Drury Lane, through whom an engagement was made with the management of
    that theatre. Kean insisted on playing Shylock, and though the management and his
    fellow-actors were incredulous as to his powers, his success was undisputed. Henceforward
    his many triumphs in London were associated with the Drury Lane Theatre, except for a
    short period from 1827 to 1829, when his services were transferred to Covent Garden. For

    <dd>last line. In <cite>The Morning Chronicle</cite> Hazlitt proceeds: ‘His fall, however,
    was too rapid. Nothing but a sword passed through the heart could occasion such a fall.
    With his innate spirit of <i>Richard</i> he would struggle with his fate to the last
    moment of ebbing life. But on the whole the performance was the most perfect of any thing
    that has been witnessed since the days of Garrick. The play was got up with great skill.
    The scenes were all painted with strict regard to historic truth. There had evidently
    been research as to identity of place, for the views of the Tower, of Crosby House, etc.
    were, in the eye of the best judges, considered as <span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>faithful representations
    according to the descriptions handed down to us. The cast of the play was also good.
    Green-room report says that Miss Smith refused the part of the <i>Queen</i>, as not great
    enough <i>forsooth</i> for her superior talents, although Mrs. Siddons, Mrs. Pope,<a
    id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c015'><sup>[58]</sup></a> Mrs.
    Crauford<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c015'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
    and others felt it to their honour to display their powers in the character. In the
    present case the absence of Miss Smith was not a misfortune, for Mrs. Glover<a id='r60'
    /><a href='#f60' class='c015'><sup>[60]</sup></a> gave to the fine
    scene with her children, a force and feeling that drew from the audience the most
    sympathetic testimonies of applause. Miss Boyce made a very interesting and elegant
    representative of <i>Lady Anne</i>. We sincerely congratulate the public on the great
    accession to the theatrical art which they have obtained in the talents of Mr. Kean. The
    experience of Saturday night convinces us that he acts from his own mental resources, and
    that he has organs to give effect to his comprehension of character. We never saw such
    admirable use made of the eye, of the lip, and generally of the muscles. We could judge
    of what he would have been if his voice had been clear from hoarseness; and we trust he
    will not repeat the difficult part till he has overcome his cold. We understand, he is
    shortly to appear in <cite>Don John</cite>, in <cite>The Chances</cite>. We know no
    character so exactly suited to his powers.’

    <dd>l. 36. In <cite>The Champion</cite> Hazlitt proceeded as follows: ‘To return to Mr. Kean.
    We would, if we had any influence with him, advise him to give one thorough reading to
    Shakspeare, without any regard to the promptbook, or to his own cue, or to the effect he
    is likely to produce on the pit or gallery. If he does this, not with a view to his
    profession, but as a study of human nature in general, he will, we trust, find his
    account in it, quite as much as in keeping company with “the great vulgar, or the
    small.”<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c015'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
    He will find there all that he wants, as well as all that he has:—sunshine and gloom,
    repose as well as energy, pleasure mixed up with pain, love and hatred, thought, feeling,
    and action, lofty imagination, with point and accuracy, general character with particular
    traits, and all that distinguishes the infinite variety of nature. He will then find that
    the interest of <cite>Macbeth</cite> does not end with the dagger scene, and that
    <cite>Hamlet</cite> is a fine character in the closet, and might be made so on the stage,
    <i>by being understood</i>. He may then hope to do justice to Shakspeare, and when he
    does this, he need not fear but that his fame will last.’

    appended to this passage:—
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>‘If <i>Desdemona</i> really “saw her husband’s visage in his mind,”<a id='r62' /><a
    href='#f62' class='c015'><sup>[62]</sup></a> or fell in love with the
    abstract idea of “his virtues and his valiant parts,”<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63'
    class='c015'><sup>[63]</sup></a> she was the only woman on record,
    either before or since, who ever did so. Shakespeare’s want of penetration in supposing
    that those are the sort of things that gain the affections, might perhaps have drawn a
    smile from the ladies, if honest <i>Iago</i> had not checked it by suggesting a different
    explanation. It should seem by this, as if the rankness and gross impropriety of the
    personal connection, the difference in age, features, colour, constitution, instead of
    being the obstacle, had been the motive of the refinement of her choice, and had, by
    beginning at the wrong end, subdued her to the amiable qualities of her lord. <i>Iago</i>
    is indeed a most learned and irrefragable doctor on the subject of love, which he defines
    to be “merely a lust of the blood, and a permission of the will.”<a id='r64' /><a
    href='#f64' class='c015'><sup>[64]</sup></a> The idea that love has
    its source in moral or intellectual excellence, in good nature or good sense, or has any
    connection with sentiment or refinement of any kind, is one of those preposterous and
    wilful errors, which ought to be extirpated for the sake of those few persons who alone
    are likely to suffer by it, whose romantic generosity and delicacy ought not to be
    sacrificed to the baseness of their nature, but who treading securely the flowery path,
    marked out for them by poets and moralists, the licensed artificers of fraud and lies,
    are dashed to pieces down the precipice, and perish without help.’ In the following
    number of <cite>The Examiner</cite> (August 14, 1814) Leigh Hunt, then in Surrey Gaol,
    wrote a long reply to this characteristic passage. In the number for September 4, the
    dramatic critic of <cite>The Examiner</cite> replied to Hazlitt’s article on the
    character of Iago. A letter from Hazlitt by way of rejoinder appeared on September 11
    (see Appendix to these notes). The critic replied (closing the controversy) on September
    18.

    <dd><i>Mr. Kean’s Richard II.</i> Shakespeare’s play with considerable alterations and
    additions (by Wroughton), produced March 9, 1815, and acted thirteen times. This is the
    first paper which Hazlitt wrote as regular dramatic critic of <cite>The Examiner</cite>.
    Leigh Hunt, the editor, who was released from prison in February 1815, had intended to
    take up this work, and had begun the year (while still in Surrey gaol) by contributing a
    series of articles on the principal actors and actresses of the day. He had also written
    one ‘Theatrical Examiner’ (February 26, on Kean’s Richard III.) before he was compelled
    by the stirring events of the ‘hundred days’ to devote all his attention to politics.
    Thus the work of dramatic critic, as well as the carrying out of the ‘Round Table’
    scheme, fell to Hazlitt. Cf. the advertisement to <cite>The Round Table</cite> (Vol <span

    by much the best thing brought out this season. It has a great deal of all that is
    necessary to a good farce, point, character, humour, and incident. It was admirably
    supported. Harley played a lively character of the bustling Fawcett-cast very happily. He
    may now stick very comfortably in the skirts of public favour, if he does not chuse to
    fling himself out of them. The only faults of this piece are, that it is too long in the
    second act, and that Miss Kelly continues somewhat too long in breeches, for the purposes
    of decorum. Mr. Barnard, as a country lad, played very well, and was deservedly encored
    in a song, “But not for me the merry bells.” This piece is described by Genest as “an
    indifferent musical farce by C. Dibdin, Jun.”’

    comes in, and lets off a culverin at his enemies, and sings a serenade to his mistress in
    concert with <cite>Grimalkin</cite>. We were glad, right glad, to see Mr. Grimaldi again.
    There was (some weeks back) an ugly report that Mr. Grimaldi was dead. We would not
    believe it; we did not like to ask any one the question, but we watched the public
    countenance for the intimation of an event which “would have eclipsed the gaiety of
    nations.”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c015'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
    We looked at the faces we met in the street, but there were no signs of general sadness;
    no one stopped his acquaintance to say, that a man of genius was no more. Here indeed he
    is again, safe and sound, and as pleasant as ever. As without the gentleman at St.
    Helena, there is an end of politics in Europe; so without the clown at Sadler’s Wells,
    there must be an end of pantomimes in this country!’

    more violence than art. It was once or twice in danger, but it hurried on so rapidly from

    we read in the <cite>Examiner</cite> of last week the following paragraph: “At Berlin,
    orders have been given by the police to leave out the titles of Mr., Mrs., and Miss,
    prefixed to the names of public actors. The females are to take the name of <i>frou</i>.
    Accordingly we see the part of Desdemona, in Shakespeare’s tragedy of

    <dd>l. 36. The article in <cite>The Examiner</cite> continues: ‘<i>Haymarket-Theatre</i>. The
    new farce in one act, called <cite>The Fair Deserter</cite>, succeeds very well here. It
    preserves the unities of time, place, and action, with the most perfect regularity. The
    merit of it is confined to the plot, and to the pretended changes of character by the
    changes of dress, which succeed one another with the rapidity and with something of the
    ingenuity of a pantomime. Mr. Duruset, a young officer of musical habits, wishes to
    release Miss MacAlpine from the power of her guardian, who is determined to marry her the
    next day. The young lady is kept under lock and key, and the difficulty is to get her out
    of the house. For this purpose Tokely, servant to Duruset, contrives to make the cook of
    the family drunk at an alehouse, where he leaves him, and carries off his official
    paraphernalia, his night-cap, apron, and long knife, in a bundle to his master. The old
    guardian (Watkinson) comes out with his lawyer from the house, and Tokely, presenting
    himself as the drunken cook, is let in. He, however, takes the key of the street door
    with him, which he shuts to, and as this intercepts the return of the old gentleman to
    his house, Tokely is forced to get out of the window by a ladder to fetch a blacksmith.
    He presently returns himself, in the character of the blacksmith, unlocks the door, but
    on the other’s refusing him a guinea for his trouble, locks it again, and walks off in
    spite of all remonstrances. The guardian is now compelled to ascend the ladder himself as
    well as he can: and while he is engaged in this ticklish adventure, the young Gallant and
    his mischievous Valet return with a couple of sentries whom Duruset orders to seize the
    poor old Guardian as a robber, and upon his declaring who and what he is, he is
    immediately charged by the lover with concealing a Deserter in his house, who is
    presently brought out, and is in fact his ward, disguised in a young officer’s uniform,
    which Tokely had given to her for that purpose. Tokely now returns dressed as an officer,
    and pretending to be the father of the young gentleman, with much blustering and little
    probability, persuades the guardian to consent to the match between his (adopted) son and
    the young lady, who has just been arrested as the Deserter, and who, upon this, throwing
    aside her disguise, the affair is concluded, to the satisfaction of every body but the
    old guardian, and the curtain drops. The bustle of this little piece keeps it alive:
    there is nothing good either in the writing or the acting of it.’

    pleasant incidents and situations, which succeed one another with careless rapidity,

    that Mr. Young played Othello like a great humming-top, “full of sound, but signifying
    nothing,”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c015'><sup>[67]</sup></a>
    and that Mr. Macready in Iago was like a mischievous boy whipping him; and that Miss
    Boyle did not play Desdemona as unaffectedly as she ought. But we hope we have been
    <span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>misinformed: and shall be glad to say so, if possible, in our next.’ The article

    <dd>l. 27. In <cite>The Examiner</cite> the article continues as follows: ‘After the play, we
    saw the <cite>Broken Sword</cite>, which is a melodrame of some interest, for it has a
    dumb boy, a murderer, and an innocent person suspected of being the perpetrator of the
    crime, in it: but it is a very ill-digested and ill-conducted piece. The introduction to
    the principal events is very tedious and round about, and the incidents themselves, when
    they arrive, come in very great disorder, and shock from their improbability and want of
    necessary connection as much as from their own nature. Mr. Terry played the part of a
    murderer with considerable gravity. We do not know at all how he came to get into so
    awkward a situation. The piece is, we understand, from common report, by Mr. Dimond.<a
    id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c015'><sup>[68]</sup></a> It is by no
    means one of his best. For he is a very impressive as well as a prolific writer in this
    way, and would do still better, if he would mind his fine writing less, and get on faster
    to the business of the story. Mr. Farley was highly interesting as <i>Estevan</i>, the
    servant who is unjustly accused of the murder of his master; in fact, he always plays
    this class of characters admirably, both as to feeling and effect; and Miss Lupino played
    the dumb <i>Florio</i> very prettily. In the first act, there was a dance by the Miss
    Dennetts.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c015'><sup>[69]</sup></a>
    If our readers have not seen this dance, we hope they will, and that they will
    <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">encore</span></i> it, which is the etiquette. Certainly, it is the prettiest thing in
    the world, except the performers in it. They are quite charming. They are three kindred
    Graces cast in the same mould: a little Trinity of innocent delights, dancing in their
    “trinal simplicities below.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' style='text-decoration: none;
    '><sup>[70]</sup></a> They are like “three red roses on a stalk;”<a id='r71' /><a
    href='#f71' class='c015'><sup>[71]</sup></a> and in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de
    trois</span></i> which they dance twice over, they are as it were twined and woven into
    garlands and festoons of blushing flowers, such as “Proserpine let fall from Dis’s
    waggon.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c015'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
    You can hardly distinguish them from one another, they are at first so alike in shape,
    age, air, look: so that the pleasure you receive from one is blended with the delight you
    receive from the other two, in a sort of provoking, pleasing confusion. Milton was
    thinking of them when he wrote the lines:—

    <dd>Yet after all we have a preference, but we will not say which it is, whether the tallest
    or the shortest, the fairest or the darkest, of this lovely, laughing trio, more gay and
    joyous than <i>Mozart’s</i>.—“But pray, dear sir, could you not give us a little bit of a
    hint which of us it is you like the very, very best?”—Yes, yes, you rogue, you know very
    well it’s you, but don’t say a word of it to either of your sisters.’ The theatrical
    criticisms during November were written by Leigh Hunt.

    <dd>l. 21. In <cite>The Examiner</cite> the article concludes as follows: ‘There have been
    two new farces this week: one at each house. One was saved and one was damned. One was
    justly damned, and the other unjustly saved. <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nota Bene</span></cite>, or <cite>The
    Two Dr. Fungus’s</cite>, shot up and disappeared in one night, notwithstanding the
    inimitable acting and well-oiled humour of Oxberry in one scene, where he makes bumpkin
    forward love to Mrs. Orger in a style equal to Liston. <cite>Love and Toothache</cite>,
    though there is neither Love nor Toothache in it, is as disagreeable as the one and as
    foolish as the other. One farce consists of a succession of low incidents without a plot,
    and the other is one tedious and improbable incident without a plot. The changing of the
    two signs, or Nota Benes of the two Fungus’s, barber and doctor, in the first, is better
    than anything in the last. The only difference is, that at the one house they contrive to
    have their pieces cast, and get them condemned at the other. Yet this is a saying without
    any meaning; for in the present case they were both got up as well as they could be.—We
    almost despair of ever seeing another good farce. Mr. H——, thou wert damned. Bright shone
    the morning on the play-bills that announced thy appearance, and the streets were filled
    with the buzz of persons asking one another if they would go to see Mr. H——, and
    answering that they would certainly; but before night the gaiety, not of the author, but
    of his friends and the town, was eclipsed, for thou wert damned! Hadst thou been
    anonymous, thou mightst have been immortal! But thou didst come to an untimely end, for
    thy tricks and for want of a better name to pass them off (as the old joke of Divine
    Right passes current under the <i>alias</i> of Legitimacy)—and since that time nothing
    worth naming has been offered to the stage!’ Hazlitt refers again to Lamb’s farce ‘Mr.
    H——’ in his essay ‘On Great and Little Things.’ See vol. <span class='fss'>VI.</span> p.
    232 and notes. The passage above, beginning ‘Mr. H——, thou wert damned’ down to ‘for want
    of a better name to pass them off’ was prefixed to the farce by Lamb, when he published
    it in 1818.

    <dd><cite>Jane Shore.</cite> January 2, 1817. Rowe’s tragedy was first produced in 1713. In
    <cite>The Examiner</cite> Hazlitt concludes this article as follows:—‘We think the
    tragedy of <cite>Jane Shore</cite>, which is founded on the dreadful calamity of hunger,
    is hardly proper to be represented in these starving times; and it ought to be prohibited
    by the Lord Chamberlain, on a principle of decorum. Of Mrs. Alsop, who is said to have an
    engagement at this theatre, we have spoken at the time when she appeared at the other
    house. Those who have before not witnessed her performance, will now probably have an
    opportunity of seeing her in company with Mrs. Mardyn, and may judge whether the
    laborious comparison we attempted between her and that lady was well or ill-founded. We
    see little alteration or improvement in her. Her figure and face are against her;
    otherwise she is certainly a very spirited little actress, and her voice is excellent.
    Her singing, however, does not correspond with what you would expect from her speaking
    tones. It wants volume and clearness. Mrs. Alsop’s laugh sometimes puts us a little in
    mind of her mother: and those parts of the character of <i>Violante</i> in which she
    succeeded best were the most joyous and exulting ones: her expression of distress is
    truly distressing. Miss Kelly played <i>Flora</i>; and it was the only time we ever saw
    her fail. She seemed to be playing tricks with the chambermaid: now those kind of people
    are as much in earnest in their absurdities as any other class of people in the world,
    and the great beauty of Miss Kelly’s acting in all other instances is, that it is more in
    downright earnest than any other acting in the world. We hope she does not think of
    growing fantastical, and <i>operatic</i>. The new pantomime is very poor.’

    full of a succession of self-inflicted horrors. Miss O’Neill played the heroine of the
    piece, whose affectation and meddling <span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>imbecility occasion all the mischief, and
    played it shockingly well. Mr. Young’s <i>Malec</i> was in his best and most imposing
    manner. The best things in <cite>The Apostate</cite> were the palpable hits at the
    Inquisition and Ferdinand the Beloved, which were taken loudly and tumultuously by the
    house, a circumstance which occasioned more horror in that wretched infatuated devoted
    tool of despotism, the Editor of <cite>The New Times</cite>,<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75'
    class='c015'><sup>[75]</sup></a> than all the other horrors of the
    piece. The Dungeons of the Holy Inquisition, whips, racks, and slow fires, kindled by
    legitimate hands, excite no horror in his breast; but that a British public still revolt
    at these things, that that fine word Legitimacy has not polluted their souls and poisoned
    their very senses with the slime and filth of slavery and superstition, this writhes his
    brain and plants scorpions in his mind, and makes his flesh crawl and shrink in agony
    from the last expression of manhood and humanity in an English audience, as if a serpent
    had wound round his heart!’

    <dd>last line. The <cite>Theatrical Examiner</cite> concludes as follows:—‘<i>Covent
    Garden.</i> Mr. Kemble played <i>Posthumus</i> here on Friday. At present, to use a
    favourite pun, all his characters are posthumous; he plays them repeatedly after <i>the
    last time</i>. We hate all suspense: and we therefore wish Mr. Kemble would go, or let it
    alone. We had much rather, for ourselves, that he staid; for there is no one to fill his
    place on the stage. The mould is broken in which he was cast. His <i>Posthumus</i> is a
    very successful piece of acting. It alternately displays that repulsive stately dignity
    of manner, or that intense vehemence of action, in which the body and the mind strain
    with eager impotence after a certain object of disappointed passion, for which Mr. Kemble
    is peculiarly distinguished. In the scenes with <i>Iachimo</i> he was particularly happy,
    and threw from him the imputations and even the proofs of <i>Imogen’s</i> inconstancy
    with a fine manly graceful scorn. The burst of inconsolable passion when the conviction
    of his <span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>treacherous rival’s success is forced upon him, was nearly as fine as
    his smothered indignation and impatience of the least suggestion against his mistress’s
    purity of character, had before been. In the concluding scene he failed. When he comes
    forward to brave <i>Iachimo</i>, and as it were to sink him to the earth by his very
    presence—‘Behold him here’—his voice and manner wanted force and impetuosity. Mr. Kemble
    executes a surprise in the most premeditated and least unexpected manner possible. What
    was said the other day in praise of this accomplished actor, might be converted into an
    objection to him: he has been too much used to figure “on tesselated pavements, when a
    fall would be fatal” to himself as well as others. He therefore manages the movements of
    his person with as much care as if he were a marble statue, and as if the least trip in
    his gait, or discomposure of his balance, would be sure to fracture some of his limbs.
    Mr. Terry was <i>Bellarius</i>, and recited some of the most beautiful passages in the
    world like the bellman’s verses. His voice is not “musical as is Apollo’s lute,” but
    “harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77'
    class='c015'><sup>[77]</sup></a> Mr. Young made a very respectable
    <i>Iachimo</i>, and Miss Foote lisped through the part of <i>Imogen</i> very prettily.
    The rest of the characters were very poorly cast.—Oh! we had forgot Mr. Liston’s
    <i>Cloten</i>: a sign that it is not so good as his <i>Lord Grizzle</i>, or <i>Lubin
    Log</i>, or a dozen more exquisite characters that he plays. It would, however, have been
    very well, if he had not <i>whisked</i> off the stage at the end of each scene, “to set
    on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78'
    class='c015'><sup>[78]</sup></a> The serenade at <i>Imogen’s</i>
    window was very beautiful, and was <i>encored</i>,—we suspect, contrary to the etiquette
    of the regular drama. But we take a greater delight in fine music than in etiquette.’

    <dd>l. 15. In <cite>The London Magazine</cite> the article concludes with a notice (signed
    ‘X.’) of a new after-piece at Drury Lane, entitled <cite>The Lady and the Devil</cite>,
    and a flattering notice of <cite>Virginius</cite> at Covent Garden. Neither of these
    notices is written in Hazlitt’s manner, and it is evident from his later account of
    Knowles’s tragedy (see pp. 455, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>) that the notice of
    <cite>Virginius</cite> at any rate is the work of another hand. It would seem that after
    seeing Kean in <cite>King Lear</cite> Hazlitt retired for a time to Winterslow.
    </dd>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd><i>The only article</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</span></i> Hazlitt probably refers to his third article,
    published in the March number (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>, pp. 403, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et seq.</span></i>), which
    was probably written while the theatres were closed in consequence of the deaths of the
    Duke of Kent (d. January 23, 1820) and George <span class='fss'>III.</span> (d. January
    29, 1820).

    <dd><i>Mr. Weathercock.</i> Thomas Griffiths Wainewright (1794-1852), afterwards well known
    as a forger and murderer, was at this time a regular contributor to <cite>The London
    Magazine</cite>, chiefly under the pseudonym of Janus Weathercock. His contributions were
    for the most part on the Fine Arts, but in the number for June 1820 (<cite>Janus’s
    Jumble</cite>, chap, <span class='fss'>III.</span>) he wrote some remarks on the
    theatres, in the course of which he chaffed ‘Mr. Drama’ (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Hazlitt) on
    some of his theatrical criticisms, and especially on his article on the minor theatres
    published in March. To these remarks Hazlitt replies in the present essay. For
    Wainewright himself see the biographical introduction to Mr. W. C. Hazlitt’s edition
    (1880) of his contributions to <cite>The London Magazine</cite>, and Mr. Bertram Dobell’s
    <cite>Sidelights on Charles Lamb</cite> (1903).

<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I believe it seldom happens that we confess ourselves to be in the dark on
any subject, till we are pretty well persuaded that no one else is able to dispel the
gloom in which we are involved. Convinced, that where our own sagacity has
failed, all further search must be vain, we resign ourselves implicitly to all the self-complacency
of conscious ignorance, and are very little obliged to any one, who
comes to disturb our intellectual repose. Something of this kind appears to have
happened to your Correspondent on the subject of the Drama. Indeed, Sir, I
should have been very cautious of attempting to remove the heap of doubts and
difficulties which seemed to oppress him, but that I thought so obvious a truth as
the connection between the manners of the age and comedy could not startle ‘the
plainest understanding;’ but the moment this obvious truth is pointed out to him,
he complains that he is ‘dazzled with excess of light,’<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c015'><sup>[79]</sup></a> and puts a ready moveable
screen of common places before him to keep it out. And then, Sir, I observe,
that to fortify himself in his scruples, and lest he should be forced to give up his
sceptical solution of sceptical doubts, he has confounded characters with you, Sir,
by a dextrous ventriloquism puts his sentiments into your mouth, and has contrived
to get the balance into his own hands, and ‘smiles delighted with the
eternal poise.’<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c015'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>After complimenting the writer of a former article, by saying that ‘<i>his</i> powers
have not languished in the dense atmosphere of logic and criticism,’ (a compliment
which I am ready to return with equal sincerity), your Correspondent proceeds—‘We
confess it did not occur to us, that it is because so many excellent comedies
have been written that so few are written at present. To our plain understanding,
on the first statement of this circumstance, a conclusion directly the
reverse would have presented itself. We should have been inclined to apply in
this instance the analogy which we find to hold in almost every other, that
relative perfection is only the result of repeated efforts, and that, as in the case of
an individual artist, till his powers are impaired by age, every successive attempt is
in general an improvement on the preceding, so in the art itself what has once
been well done, usually leads to something better.’—On this passage I might
observe, first, that I am always apt to distrust these modest pretensions to plain
understanding. They signify nothing more than that an opinion is contrary to
our own, and that we will not take the trouble to examine it. And besides, we
all of us refine as much and as well as we are able; only we are not willing that
others should refine more than we do. Secondly, Sir, the analogy to which your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>Correspondent appeals in support of his hypothesis, that the arts are uniformly
progressive, totally fails; it applies to science, and not to art.</p>

<p class='c021'>Farther, your Correspondent observes, ‘That the production of many good
comedies should render us more severe towards bad ones, and bad poets more
averse from exposing themselves, would appear much more likely than that
exactly the reverse of all this should happen. We naturally expect from a landlord,
who at the commencement of a repast regales us with elegant wines, that he
will not place homely ale or insipid porter before us towards the end of it. It
was D’Alembert, we believe, who suggested as a great improvement in modern
literature, that all our books should be collected together every fifty years, for the
purpose of making a bonfire of them,’ &amp;c. All this may be very true, but I really
do not see what it has to do with the question.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘For true no-meaning puzzles more than wit.’<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c015'><sup>[81]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>I am afraid he will think I am at cross-purposes with his theories, but it is
really because they appear to me at cross-purposes with facts. For instance, the
bad poets do not in the present case seem very backward to expose themselves;
but what is it that hinders the good ones (rising like so many Phœnixes out of the
ashes of their predecessors) from claiming the admiration that is due to them?
Surely, if every succeeding writer improved upon the last, and ‘what was once
well done always led to something better,’ the managers would not damp the rising
flame. The progress of comedy among us appears to have been just the reverse of
what your Correspondent would have anticipated; namely, from elegant wines to
insipid porter, and our critic (if I mistake him not), would make the matter still
worse by diluting this insipid stuff with water, in order that it may become still
more tasteless, and according to him, more elegant and refined. Our elder comic
writers provided choice wines, strong liquors and rich viands of all kinds for the
entertainment of the public, while our author, seated at the full banquet, like
Christopher Sly at the Duke’s table, calls out incessantly for ‘a pot of the smallest
ale.’<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c015'><sup>[82]</sup></a> As to the project of D’Alembert, I have no great objection to it. Only
I would propose as a compromise that we should let our present stock remain on
hand, and that nothing but reviews and newspaper criticisms should be written for
the next fifty years, by which means I shall keep possession of Jonson, Farquhar,
Wycherley, Congreve, and Smollett, and in the mean time your correspondent may
take a surfeit of Mr. Tobin’s <cite>Honey Moon, The Duenna</cite> (for whom I have a great
respect), and Madame de Stael. I cannot, however, agree with him in the
building up of his chronological ladder of taste. Congreve did not improve upon
Wycherley, because he was not indebted to him, and Sheridan was indebted to
Congreve without improving upon him. Your Correspondent, Sir, writes very
well about these authors, but as if he had not read them. As to the hardship of
which he complains, that our fathers should have laughed for themselves and for
us too, it is but the common course of nature. It is not a misfortune peculiar to
ourselves. Even Madame de Stael is forced to go a hundred and fifty years back,
for an author to insult the English with, on their want of comic genius, and of
the knowledge of those traits peculiar to the refinements of French manners, but
which <i>yet paint human nature in every country</i>. I agree with your Correspondent in
his first letter, that though we cannot write good Comedies, we can assign good
reasons why they are not written; and I think we have, between us, made out
the reason of the present want of dramatic writers, though I doubt if we should,
both of us together, make even half a Menander. But he will have all the
advantages on his side, and be as merry as he is wise. Why, after he has laughed
folly out of countenance, is he determined to laugh at her as much as ever, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>make good sense or absurdity equally subservient to his spleen? He is bent on
laughing at all events—at every thing or nothing; and if he does not find things
ridiculous, he will make them so. The fantastic resolution of <i>Biron</i>, ‘to laugh a
twelvemonth in an hospital,’<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c015'><sup>[83]</sup></a> does not exceed the preposterous ambition of your
Correspondent, to extract the soul of mirth out of the schools of philosophy. We
cannot expect to reconcile opposite things. If he or I were to put ourselves into
the stage, to go from Salisbury to London, I dare say we should not meet with the
same number of odd accidents or ludicrous distresses on the road, that befel <i>Parson
Adams</i>; but why, if we get into a common vehicle, and submit to the conveniences
of modern travelling, do we complain of the want of adventures? Modern
manners may be compared to a modern stage-coach: our limbs may be a little
cramped with the confinement, and we may grow drowsy; but we arrive safe,
without any very amusing or any very sad accident, at out journey’s end. But
your Correspondent sees nothing in the progress of modern manners and characters
but a vague, abstract progression from grossness to refinement, marked on a
graduated scale of human perfectibility. This sweeping distinction appears to him
to explain satisfactorily the whole difference between all sorts of manners, and all
kinds and degrees of dramatic excellence. These two words stand him instead of
other ideas on the texture of society, or the nature of the dramatic art. He is not,
however, quite consistent on this subject, for in one place he says, that ‘the stock
of folly in the world is in no danger of being diminished,’ and in the next sentence,
that there is a progression in society, an age of grossness and an age of refinement,
and he only wonders that the progress of the stage does not keep pace with it.
Now the reason why I do not share his wonder is, that though I think the
quantity of dull, dry, serious, incorrigible folly in the world is in no danger of
being diminished, yet I think the stock of lively, dramatic, entertaining, laughable
folly is, and necessarily must be, diminished by the progress of that <i>mechanical</i>
refinement which consists in throwing our follies, as it were, into a common
stock, and moulding them in the same general form. Our peculiarities have
become insipid sameness; our eccentricity servile imitation; our wit, wisdom at
second-hand; our prejudices indifference; our feelings not our own; our distinguishing
characteristic the want of all character. We are become a nation of
authors and readers, and even this distinction is confounded by the mediation of
the reviewers. We all follow the same profession, which is criticism, each
individual is every thing but himself, not one but all mankind’s epitome, and the
gradations of vice and virtue, of sense and folly, of refinement and grossness of
character, seem lost in a kind of intellectual <i>hermaphroditism</i>. But on this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabula
rasa</span></i>, according to your Correspondent, the most lively and sparkling hues of
comedy may be laid. His present reasoning gives a very different turn to the
question he at first proposed. He appears to have set out with a theory of his own
about the production of comic excellence, in which it was entirely regulated by the
state of the market, and to have supposed that as long as authors continued to
write plays, and managers to accept them, that is, so long as the thing answered in
the way of trade, Comedy would go on pretty much as it had hitherto done, to the
end of the world. But finding that this was not exactly the case, he takes his
stand near the avenues leading to the manager’s door, and happening to see a
young man of worth and talents, with great knowledge of the world, and of the
refinements of polished society, come out with his piece in his hand, and a face of
disappointment, he is no longer at a loss for the secret of the decline of Comedy
among us, and proceeds cautiously to hint his discovery to the world. But it being
suggested to him that the change of manners, produced partly by the stage itself,
and the total disappearance of the characters which before formed the very life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>soul of Comedy, might have something to do with the decline of the Stage, he will
not hear a word of it, but says, that this circumstance, so far from shewing why
our modern Comedies <i>are not so good</i> as the old ones, proves that they <i>ought to be
better</i>; that the more we are become like one another, or like nothing, the less
distinction of character we have, the greater discrimination must it require to
bring it out; that the less ridiculous our manners become, the more scope do they
afford for art and ingenuity in discovering our weak sides and shades of infirmity;
and that the greatest sameness and monotony must in the end produce the most
exquisite variety. For a plain man, this is very well. It is on the same principle,
that some writers have contended that Scotland is more fertile than England, the
excellence of the crop being in proportion to the barrenness of the soil. What a
pity it is, that so ingenious a theory should not have the facts on its side; and
that the perfection of satire should not be found to keep pace with the want of
materials. It is rather too much to assume on a mere hypothesis, that the present
manners are equally favourable to the production of the highest comic excellence,
till they do produce it. Even in France, where encouragement is given to the
noblest and most successful exertions of genius by the sure prospect of profit to
yourself or your descendants, every time your piece is acted in any corner of the
empire, to the latest posterity, we find the best critics going back to the grossness
and illiberality of the age of Louis <span class='fss'>XIV.</span> for the production of the best comedies;
which is rather extraordinary, considering the infinitely refined state of manners in
France, and the infinite encouragement given to dramatic talent. But has it never
occurred to your Correspondent, as a solution of this difficulty, that there is a
difference between refinement and imbecility, between general knowledge and
personal elegance, between metaphysical subtlety and stage-effect? Does he think
all manners, all kinds of folly, and all shades of character equally fit for dramatic
representation? Does he not perceive that there is a point where minuteness of
distinction becomes laborious foolery, and where the slenderness of the materials
must baffle the skill and destroy the exertions of the artist? He insists, indeed, on
pulling off the mask of folly, by some ingenious device, though she has been stripped
of it long ago; and forced to compose her features into a decent appearance of
gravity; and he next proceeds to apply a microscope of a new construction, to
detect the freckles on her face and inequalities in her skin, in order to communicate
his amusing discoveries to the audience, as some philosophical lecturer does
the result of his chemical experiments on the decomposition of substances to the
admiring circle. There is no end of this. Your Correspondent confesses that ‘we
are drilled into a sort of stupid decorum and apparent uniformity,’ but this he
converts into an advantage. His penetrating eye is infinitely delighted with the
picturesque appearance of so many imperceptible deviations from a right line, and
mathematical inclinations from the perpendicular. The picture of the Flamborough
Family, painted with each an orange in his hand, must have been a masterpiece of
nice discrimination and graceful inflection. Upon this principle of going to work
the wrong way, and of making something out of nothing, we must reverse all our
rules of taste and common sense. No Comedy can be perfect till the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis
personæ</span></i> might be reversed without creating much confusion: or the ingredients of
character ought to be so blended and poured repeatedly from one vessel into
another that the difference would be perceptible only to the finest palate. Thus,
if Molière had lived in the present day, he would not have drawn his Avare, his
Tartuffe and his Misanthrope with those strong touches and violent contrasts
which he has done, but with those delicate traits which are common to human
nature in general, that is, his Miser without avarice, his Hypocrite without design,
and his Misanthrope without disgust at the vices of mankind. Or instead of the
heroines of his <cite>School for Women</cite> (<i>Alithea</i> and <i>Miss Peggy</i>, which Wycherley has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>contrived to make the English understand) we should have had two sentimental
young ladies brought up much in the same way, with nice shades of difference,
which we should have been hardly able to distinguish, subscribing to the same
circulating library, reading the same novels and poems, one preferring Gertrude
of Wyoming to The Lady of the Lake, and the other The Lady of the Lake to
Gertrude of Wyoming, differing in their opinions on points of taste or systems of
mineralogy, and delivering dissertations on the arts with Corinna of Italy.</p>

<p class='c021'>Considering the difficulty of the task which by our author’s own account is
thus imposed upon modern writers, may we not suppose this very difficulty to
have operated to deter them from the pursuit of dramatic excellence. But I
suspect that your Correspondent has taken up his complaint of the deficiency of
refined Comedy too hastily, and that he need not despair of finding some modelled
upon his favourite principles. Guided by his theory he should have sought them
out in their remote obscurity, and have obtruded them on the public eye. He
might have formed a new era of criticism, and have claimed the same merit as
Voltaire, when he discovered that the English had one good Tragedy, Cato. Your
Correspondent, availing himself of the idea that frivolity, taste, and elegance are
the same, might have shewn how much superior <cite>The Heiress</cite> of Burgoyne was to
<cite>The Confederacy</cite>, or <cite>The Way of the World</cite>, and <cite>The Basil</cite> of <cite>Miss Bailey</cite>, to <cite>Romeo
and Juliet</cite>. He would have found ample scope in the blooming desert for endless
discoveries—of beauties of the most shadowy kind, of fancies ‘wan that hang the
pensive head,’<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c015'><sup>[84]</sup></a> of evanescent smiles, and sighs that breathe not, of delicacy that
shrinks from the touch, and feebleness that scarce supports itself, an elaborate
vacuity of all thought, and an artificial dearth of sense, spirit, wit and character!
I can assure your Correspondent, there has been no want of Comedies to his taste;
but the taste of the public was not so far advanced. It was found necessary to
appeal to something more palpable: and so, in this interval of want of characters
in real life, the actors amuse themselves with taking off one another.</p>

<p class='c021'>But your Correspondent will have it that there are different degrees of refinement
in wit and pleasantry, and he seems to suppose that the best of our old
Comedies are no better than the coarse jests of a set of country clowns—a sort of
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comedies bourgeoises</span></i>, compared with the admirable productions which might and
ought to be written. Even our modern dramatists, he suspects, are not so familiar
with high life as they ought to be. ‘They have not seen the Court, and if they
have not seen the Court their manner must be damnable.’<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c015'><sup>[85]</sup></a> Leaving him to
settle this last point with the poetical Lords and Ladies of the present day, I am
afraid he has himself fallen into the very error he complains of, and would degrade
genteel Comedy from a high Court Lady into a literary prostitute. What does he
mean by refinement? Does he find none in <i>Millamant</i>, and her morning dreams,
in <i>Sir Roger de Coverly</i> and his widow? Did not Congreve, Wycherley, and
Suckling approach tolerably near ‘the ring of mimic Statesmen, and their merry
King?’<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c015'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Does he suppose that their fine ladies were mere rustics, because they
did not compose metaphysical treatises, or their fine gentlemen inexperienced
tyros, because they had not been initiated into the infinitely refined society of Paris
and of Baron Grimm? Is there no distinction between an Angelica, and a Miss
Prue, a Valentine, a Tattle, and a Ben? Where in the annals of modern
literature will he find anything more refined, more deliberate, more abstracted in
vice than the Nobleman in Amelia? Are not the compliments which Pope paid
to his friends,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c015'><sup>[87]</sup></a> to St. John, Murray, and Cornbury, equal in taste and elegance
to those which passed between the French philosophers and their patrons?—Are
there no traits in Sterne?—Is not Richardson minute enough?—Must we part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>with Sophia Western and Clarissa for the loves of the plants and the triangles?—The
beauty of these writers in general was, that they gave every kind and
gradation of character, and they did this, because their portraits were taken from
life. They were true to nature, full of meaning, perfectly understood and executed
in every part. Their coarseness was not mere vulgarity, their refinement was not
a mere negation of precision. They refined <i>upon</i> characters, instead of refining
them <i>away</i>. Their refinement consisted in working out the parts, not in leaving
a vague outline. They painted human nature as it was, and as they saw it with
individual character and circumstances, not human nature in general, abstracted
from time, place and circumstance. Strength and refinement are so far from
being incompatible, that they assist each other, as the hardest bodies admit of the
finest touches and the brightest polish. But there are some minds that never
understand any thing, but by a negation of its opposite. There is a strength
without refinement, which is grossness, as there is a refinement without strength
or effect, which is insipidity. Neither are grossness and refinement of manners
inconsistent with each other in the same period. The grossness of one class adds
to the refinement of another, by circumscribing it, by rendering the feeling more
pointed and exquisite, by irritating our self-love, &amp;c. There can be no great
refinement of character where there is no distinction of persons. The character
of a gentleman is a <i>relative term</i>. The diffusion of knowledge, of artificial and
intellectual equality, tends to level this distinction, and to confound that nice
perception and high sense of honour, which arises from conspicuousness of
situation, and a perpetual attention to personal propriety and the claims of
personal respect. Your Correspondent, I think, mistakes refinement of individual
character for general knowledge and intellectual subtlety, with which it has little
more to do than with the dexterity of a rope-dancer or juggler. The age of
chivalry is gone with the improvements in the art of war, which superseded
personal courage, and the character of a gentleman must disappear with those
refinements in intellect which render the advantages of rank and situation common
almost to any one. The bag-wig and sword followed the helmet and the spear,
when these outward insignia no longer implied a real superiority, and were a
distinction without a difference. Even the grossness of a state of mixed and
various manners receives a degree of refinement from contrast and opposition, by
being defined and implicated with circumstances. The <cite>Upholsterer</cite> in <cite>The Tatler</cite> is
not a mere vulgar politician. His intense feeling of interest and curiosity about
what does not at all concern him, displays itself in the smallest things, assumes
the most eccentric forms, and the peculiarity of his absurdity masks itself under
various shifts and evasions, which the same folly, when it becomes epidemic and
universal as it has since done, would not have occasion to resort to. In general
it is only in a state of mere barbarism or indiscriminate refinement that we are
to look for extreme grossness or complete insipidity. Our modern dramatists
indeed have happily contrived to unite both extremes. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne tulit punctum.</span></i><a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c015'><sup>[88]</sup></a> On
a soft ground of sentiment they have daubed in the gross absurdities of modern
manners void of character, have blended metaphysical waiting maids with jockey
noblemen, and the humours of the four in hand club, and fill up the piece by
some vile and illiberal caricature of particular individuals known on the town.</p>

<p class='c021'>To return once more to your Correspondent, who condemns all this as much as
I do. He is for refining Comedy into a pure intellectual abstraction, the shadow
of a shade. Will he forgive me if I suggest, as an addition to his theory, that
the drama in general might be constructed on the same abstruse and philosophical
principles. As he imagines that the finest Comedies may be formed without
individual character, so the deepest Tragedies might be composed without real
<span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>passion. The slightest and most ridiculous distresses might be improved by the
help of art and metaphysical aid, into the most affecting scenes. A young man
might naturally be introduced as the hero of a philosophic drama, who had lost
the gold medal for a prize poem; or a young lady, whose verses had been severely
criticized in the reviews. Nothing could come amiss to this rage for speculative
refinement; or the actors might be supposed to come forward, not in any
character, but as a sort of Chorus, reciting speeches on the general miseries of
human life, or reading alternately a passage out of Seneca’s Morals or Voltaire’s
Candide. This might by some be thought a great improvement on English
Tragedy, or even on the French.</p>

<p class='c021'>In fact, Sir, the whole of our author’s reasoning proceeds on a total misconception
of the nature of the Drama itself. It confounds philosophy with poetry,
laboured analysis with intuitive perception, general truth with individual observation.
He makes the comic muse a dealer in riddles, and an expounder of
hieroglyphics, and a taste for dramatic excellence, a species of the second sight.
He would have the Drama to be the most remote, and it is the most substantial
and real of all things. It represents not only looks, but motion and speech. The
painter gives only the former, looks without action or speech, and the mere writer
only the latter, words without looks or action. Its business and its use is to
express the thoughts and character in the most striking and instantaneous manner,
in the manner most like reality. It conveys them in all their truth and subtlety,
but in all their force and with all possible effect. It brings them into action,
obtrudes them on the sight, embodies them in habits, in gestures, in dress, in
circumstances, and in speech. It renders every thing overt and ostensible, and
presents human nature not in its elementary principles or by general reflections,
but exhibits its essential quality in all their variety of combination, and furnishes
subjects for perpetual reflection.</p>

<p class='c021'>But the instant we begin to refine and generalise beyond a certain point, we are
reduced to abstraction, and compelled to see things, not as individuals, or as
connected with action and circumstances, but as universal truths, applicable in a
degree to all things, and in their extent to none, which therefore it would be
absurd to predicate of individuals, or to represent to the senses. The habit, too,
of detaching these abstract species and fragments of nature, destroys the power of
combining them in complex characters, in every degree of force and variety. The
concrete and the abstract cannot co-exist in the same mind. We accordingly
find, that to genuine comedy succeed satire and novels, the one dealing in general
character and description, and the other making out particulars by the assistance
of narrative and comment. Afterwards come traits, and collections of anecdotes,
bon mots, topics, and quotations, &amp;c. which are applicable to any one, and are just
as good told of one person as another. Thus the trio in the Memoirs of M.
Grimm, attributed to three celebrated characters, on the death of a fourth, might
have the names reversed, and would lose nothing of its effect. In general these
traits, which are so much admired, are a sort of systematic libels on human
nature, which make up, by their malice and <i>acuteness</i>, for their want of wit
and sense.</p>

<p class='c021'>I have already taken notice of the quotation from Madame de Stael, with
which your Correspondent concludes. I can only oppose to it the authority of
Sterne and Sir Richard Steele, who thought that the excellence of the English in
comedy was in a great measure owing to the originality and variety of character
among them [See Sentimental Journey, and Tatler, No. &#8196;&#8196;&#8196;&#8196;.]<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c015'><sup>[89]</sup></a> With respect to
that extreme refinement of taste which the fair Author arrogates to the French,
they are neither entirely without it, nor have they so much as they think. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>two most refined things in the world are the story of the Falcon in Boccacio, and
the character of Griselda in Chaucer, of neither of which the French would have
the smallest conception, because they do not depend on traits, or minute circumstances,
or turns of expression, but in infinite simplicity and truth, and an everlasting
sentiment. We might retort upon Mad. de Stael what she sometimes says
in her own defence, That we understand all in other writers that is worth understanding.
As to Moliere, he is quite out of the present question; he lived long
before the era of French philosophy and refinement, and is besides almost an
English author, quite a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">barbare</span></i>, in all in which he excels. He was unquestionably
one of the greatest comic geniuses that ever lived, a man of infinite wit, gaiety,
and invention, full of life and laughter, the very soul of mirth and whim. But
it cannot be denied, that his plays are in general mere farces, without real nature
or refined character, totally void of probability. They could not be carried on a
moment without a perfect collusion between the parties, to wink at impossibilities,
by contradicting and acting in defiance of all common sense. For instance, take
the <i>Medecin malgre lui</i>, in which a common wood-cutter voluntarily takes upon
himself, and supports through a long play, the character of a learned physician,
without exciting the least suspicion, but which is, notwithstanding the absurdity
of the plot, one of the most laughable and truly comic things that can be
imagined. The rest of his lighter pieces are of the same description—mere
gratuitous fictions and exaggerations of nature. As to his serious Comedies, as
the <cite>Tartuffe</cite> and <cite>Misanthrope</cite>, nothing can be more objectionable, and the chief
objection to them is that nothing is more hard than to read them through. They
have all the improbability and extravagance of the rest, united with all the tedious
common-place prosing of French declamation. What can exceed the absurdity of
the <cite>Misanthrope</cite>, who leaves his mistress after every proof of her attachment and
constancy, merely because she will not submit to the <i>technical formality</i> of going
to live with him in a desert? The characters which she gives of her friends in
the beginning of the play are very admirable satires, but not Comedy. The same
remarks apply in a greater degree to the <cite>Tartuffe</cite>. The long speeches and
reasonings in this Play may be very good logic, or rhetoric, or philosophy, or any
thing but Comedy. They are dull pompous casuistry. The improbability is
monstrous. This play is indeed invaluable, as a lasting monument of the credulity
of the French to all verbal professions of virtue or wisdom, and its existence can
only be accounted for from that astonishing and tyrannical predominance which
words exercise over things in the mind of every Frenchman.</p>

<p class='c021'>In short, Sir, I conceive, that neither M. de Stael nor your Correspondent has
hit upon the true theory of refinement. To suppose that we can go on refining
for ever with vivacity and effect, embodying vague abstractions, and particularising
flimsy generalities,—‘shewing the very body of the age, its form and pressure,’<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c015'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
though it has neither form nor pressure left,—seems to me the height of speculative
absurdity. That undefined ‘frivolous space,’ beyond which Madame de Stael
regards as ‘the region of taste and elegance,’ is, indeed, nothing but the very
Limbo of Vanity, the land of chiromancy and occult conceit, and paradise of fools,
where, according to your correspondent,</p>

<h3 class='c008'>ON MR KEAN’S IAGO</h3>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>Mr. Examiner</span>,—I was not at all aware that in the remarks which I offered
on Mr. Kean’s <i>Iago</i> my opinions would clash with those already expressed by the
respectable writer of the Theatrical Examiner: for I did not mean to object to
‘the gay and careless air which Mr. Kean threw over his representation of that
arch villain,’ but to its being nothing but carelessness and gaiety; and I thought
it perfectly consistent with a high degree of admiration of this extraordinary actor,
to suppose that he might have carried an ingenious and original idea of the
character to a paradoxical extreme. In some respects, your Correspondent seems
to have mistaken what I have said; for he observes that I have entered into an
analysis to shew, ‘that <i>Iago</i> is a malignant being, who hates his fellow-creatures,
and doats on mischief and crime as the best means of annoying the objects of his
hate.’ Now this is the very reverse of what I intended to shew; for so far from
thinking that <i>Iago</i> is ‘a ruffian or a savage, who pursues wickedness for its own
sake,’ I am ready to allow that he is a pleasant amusing sort of gentleman, but
with an over-activity of mind that is dangerous to himself and others; that so far
from hating his fellow-creatures, he is perfectly regardless of them, except as they
may afford him food for the exercise of his spleen, and that ‘he doats on mischief
and crime,’ not ‘as the best means of annoying the objects of his hate,’ but as
necessary to keep himself in that strong state of excitement which his natural
constitution requires, or, to express it proverbially, in <i>perpetual hot water</i>. Iago is
a man who will not suffer himself or any one else to be at rest; he has an insatiable
craving after action, and action of the most violent kind. His conduct
and motives require some explanation; but they cannot be accounted for from
his interest or his passions,—his love of himself, or hatred of those who are the
objects of his persecution: these are both of them only the occasional pretext for
his cruelty, and are in fact both of them subservient to his love of power and
mischievous irritability. I repeat, that I consider this sort of unprincipled self-will
as a very different thing from common malignity; but I conceive it also just
as remote from indifference or levity. In one word, the malice of <i>Iago</i> is not
<i>personal</i>, but <i>intellectual</i>. Mr. Kean very properly got rid of the brutal ferocity
which had been considered as the principle of the character, and then left it without
any principle at all. He has mistaken the want of moral feeling, which is
inseparable from the part, for constitutional ease and general indifference, which
are just as incompatible with it. Mr. Kean’s idea seems to have been, that the
most perfect callousness ought to accompany the utmost degree of inhumanity;
and so far as relates to callousness to moral considerations, this is true; but that is
not the question. If our Ancient had no other object, or principle of action but
his indifference to the feelings of others, he gives himself a great deal of trouble
to no purpose. If he has nothing else to set him in motion, he had much better
remain quiet than be broken on the rack. Mere carelessness and gaiety, then, do
not account for the character. But Mr. Kean acted it with nearly the same easy
air with which Mr. Braham sings a song in an opera, or with which a comic actor
delivers a side-speech in an after-piece.</p>

<p class='c021'>But the character of <i>Iago</i>, says your Correspondent, has nothing to do with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>manner of acting it. We are to look to the business of the play. Is this then so
very pleasant, or is the part which <i>Iago</i> undertakes and executes the perfection of
easy comedy? I should conceive quite the contrary. The rest of what your
Correspondent says on this subject is ‘ingenious, but not convincing.’ It amounts
to this, that <i>Iago</i> is a hypocrite, and that a hypocrite should always be gay. This
must depend upon circumstances. <i>Tartuffe</i> was a hypocrite, yet he was not gay:
<i>Joseph Surface</i> was a hypocrite, but grave and plausible: <i>Blifil</i> was a hypocrite, but
cold, formal and reserved. The hypocrite is naturally grave, that is, thoughtful,
and dissatisfied with things as they are, plotting doubtful schemes for his own
advancement and the ruin of others, studying far-fetched evasions, double-minded
and double-faced.—Now all this is an effort, and one that is often attended with
disagreeable consequences; and it seems more in character that a man whose
invention is thus kept on the rack, and his feelings under painful restraint, should
rather strive to hide the wrinkle rising on his brow, and the malice at his heart,
under an honest concern for his friend, or the serene and regulated smile of steady
virtue, than that he should wear the light-hearted look and easy gaiety of thoughtless
constitutional good humour. The presumption therefore is not in favour of
the lively, laughing, comic mien of hypocrisy. Gravity is its most obvious
resource, and, with submission, it is quite as effectual a one. But it seems, that
if <i>Iago</i> had worn this tremendous mask, ‘the gay and idle world would have had
nothing to do with him.’ Why, indeed, if he had only intended to figure at a
carnival or a ridotto, to dance with the women or drink with the men, this
objection might be very true. But <i>Iago</i> has a different scene to act in, and has
other thoughts in his contemplation. One would suppose that <cite>Othello</cite> contained no
other adventures than those which are to be met with in <cite>Anstey’s Bath Guide</cite>,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c015'><sup>[92]</sup></a> or
in one of <i>Miss Burney’s</i> novels. The smooth smiling surface of the world of
fashion is not the element he delights to move in: he is the busy meddling fiend
‘who rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm,’<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c015'><sup>[93]</sup></a> triumphing over the scattered
wrecks, and listening to the shrieks of death. I cannot help thinking that Mr.
Kean’s <i>Iago</i> must be wrong, for it seems to have abstracted your Correspondent
entirely from the subject of the play. Indeed it is one great proof of Mr. Kean’s
powers, but which at the same time blinds the audience to his defects, that they
think of little else in any play but of the part he acts. ‘What! a gallant Venetian
turned into a musty philosopher! Go away, and beg the reversion of Diogenes’
tub! Go away, the coxcomb <i>Roderigo</i> will think you mighty dull, and will
answer your requests for money with a yawn; the cheerful spirited <i>Cassio</i> will
choose some pleasanter companion to sing with him over his cups; the fiery
<cite>Othello</cite> will fear lest his philosophic Ancient will be less valorously incautious in
the day of battle, and that he will not storm a fort with the usual uncalculating
intrepidity.’ Now, the coxcomb <i>Roderigo</i> would probably have answered his
demands for money with a yawn, though he had been ever so facetious a companion,
if he had not thought him useful to his affairs. He employs him as a man of
business, as a dextrous, cunning, plotting rogue, who is to betray his master and
debauch his wife, an occupation for which his good humour or apparent want
of thought would not particularly qualify him. An accomplice in knavery ought
always to be a solemn rogue, and withal a casuist, for he thus becomes our better
conscience, and gives a sanction to the roguery. <i>Cassio</i> does not invite <i>Iago</i> to
drink with him, but is prevailed upon against his will to join him; and <cite>Othello</cite>
himself owes his misfortunes, in the first instance, to his having repulsed the
applications of <i>Iago</i> to be made his lieutenant. He himself affects to be blunt
and unmannerly in his conversation with <i>Desdemona</i>. There is no appearance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>any cordiality towards him in <cite>Othello</cite>, nor of his having been a general favourite
(for such persons are not usually liked), nor of his having ever been employed but
for his understanding and discretion. He every where owes his success to his
intellectual superiority, and not to the pleasantness of his manners. At no time
does <cite>Othello</cite> put implicit confidence in <i>Iago’s</i> personal character, but demands his
proofs; or when he founds his faith on his integrity, it is from the gravity of his
manner: ‘Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more,’ <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</span></i><a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c015'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c021'>Your Correspondent appeals to the manners of women of the town, to prove
that ‘there is a fascination in an open manner.’ I do not see what this has to
do with <i>Iago</i>. Those who promise to give only pleasure, do not of course put on
a melancholy face, or ape the tragic muse. The Sirens would not lull their
victims by the prophetic menaces of the Furies. <i>Iago</i> did not profess to be the
harbinger of welcome news. The reference to Milton’s <cite>Satan</cite> and <i>Lovelace</i> is
equally misplaced. If <i>Iago</i> had himself endeavoured to seduce <i>Desdemona</i>, the
cases would have been parallel. <i>Lovelace</i> had to seduce a virtuous woman to
pleasure, by presenting images of pleasure, by fascinating her senses, and by
keeping out of sight every appearance of danger or disaster. <i>Iago</i>, on the
contrary, shews to <cite>Othello</cite> that he has ‘a monster in his thought’;<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c015'><sup>[95]</sup></a> and it is his
object to make him believe this by dumb show, by the knitting of his brows, by
stops and starts, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</span></i> before he is willing to commit himself by words. Milton’s
devil also could only succeed by raising up the most voluptuous and delightful
expectations in the mind of Eve, and by himself presenting an example of the
divine effects produced by eating of the tree of knowledge. Gloom and gravity
were here out of the question. Yet how does Milton describe the behaviour of
this arch-hypocrite, when he is about to complete his purpose?</p>

<p class='c021'>If this impassioned manner was justifiable here, where the serpent had only to
persuade Eve to her imagined good, how much more was it proper in <i>Iago</i>, who
had to tempt <cite>Othello</cite> to his damnation? When he hints to <cite>Othello</cite> that his wife
is unfaithful to him—when he tells his proofs, at which <cite>Othello</cite> swoons, when he
advises him to strangle her, and undertakes to dispatch <i>Cassio</i> from his zeal in
‘wronged Othello’s service,’<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c015'><sup>[97]</sup></a> should he do this with a smiling face, or a face of
indifference? If a man drinks or sings with me, he may perhaps drink or sing
much as Mr. Kean drinks or sings with <i>Roderigo</i> and <i>Cassio</i>: if he bids me good
day, or wishes me a pleasant journey, a frank and careless manner will well
become him; but if he assures me that I am on the edge of a precipice, or waylaid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>by assassins, or that some tremendous evil has befallen me, with the same
fascinating gaiety of countenance and manner, I shall be little disposed to credit
either his sincerity or friendship or common sense.</p>

<p class='c021'>Your Correspondent accounts for the security and hilarity of <i>Iago</i>, in such
circumstances, from his sense of superiority and his certainty of success. First,
this is not the account given in the text, which I should prefer to any other
authority on the subject. Secondly, if he was quite certain of the success of his
experiment, it was not worth the making, for the only provocation to it was the
danger and difficulty of the enterprise; and at any rate, whatever were his
feelings, the appearance of anxiety and earnestness was necessary to the accomplishment
of his purpose. ‘He should assume a virtue, if he had it not.’<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c015'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Besides,
the success of his experiment was not of that kind even which has been called
<i>negative</i> success, but proved of a very tragical complexion both to himself and
others. I can recollect nothing more to add, without repeating what I have
before said, which I am afraid would be to no purpose. I am, Sir, your obedient

<p class='c014'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. A child that has hid itself out of the way in sport, is under a great temptation

<p class='c014'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. His words are—‘If in having our ideas in the memory ready at hand consists
quickness of parts, in this of having them unconfused, and being able nicely to
distinguish one thing from another, where there is but the least difference, consists
in a great measure the exactness of judgment and clearness of reason, which is to
be observed in one man above another. And hence, perhaps, may be given some
reason of that common observation, that men who have a great deal of wit and
prompt memories, have not always the clearest judgment or deepest reason. For
wit lying mostly in the assemblage of ideas, and putting them together with
quickness and variety, wherein can be found any resemblance or congruity, thereby
to make up pleasant pictures and agreeable visions in the fancy; judgment, on the
contrary, lies quite on the other side, in separating carefully one from another,
ideas wherein can be found the least difference, thereby to avoid being misled by
similitude, and by affinity to take one thing for another.’ (<cite>Essay</cite>, vol. i. p. 143.)
This definition, such as it is, Mr. Locke took without acknowledgment from
Hobbes, who says in his Leviathan, ‘This difference of quickness in imagining is
caused by the difference of men’s passions, that love and dislike some one thing,
some another, and therefore some men’s thoughts run one way, some another, and
are held to and observe differently the things that pass through their imagination.
And whereas in this succession of thoughts there is nothing to observe in the
things they think on, but either in what they be like one another, or in what they
be unlike, those that observe their similitudes, in case they be such as are but
rarely observed by others, are said to have a good wit, by which is meant on this
occasion a good fancy. But they that observe their differences and dissimilitudes,
which is called distinguishing and discerning and judging between thing and thing;
in case such discerning be not easy, are said to have a good judgment; and
particularly in matter of conversation and business, wherein times, places, and
persons are to be discerned, this virtue is called discretion. The former, that is,
fancy, without the help of judgment, is not commended for a virtue; but the
latter, which is judgment or discretion, is commended for itself, without the help
of fancy.’ <cite>Leviathan</cite>, p. 32.</p>

entitled <i>One Man’s Profit is another’s Loss</i>, in which he has nearly anticipated
Mandeville’s celebrated paradox of private vices being public benefits:—</p>

<p class='c014'>‘Demades, the Athenian, condemned a fellow-citizen, who furnished out funerals,
for demanding too great a price for his goods: and if he got an estate, it must be
by the death of a great many people: but I think it a sentence ill grounded,
forasmuch as no profit can be made, but at the expense of some other person, and
that every kind of gain is by that rule liable to be condemned. The tradesman
thrives by the debauchery of youth, and the farmer by the dearness of corn; the
architect by the ruin of buildings, the officers of justice by quarrels and law-suits;
nay, even the honour and function of divines is owing to our mortality and vices.
No physician takes pleasure in the health even of his best friends, said the ancient
Greek comedian, nor soldier in the peace of his country; and so of the rest.
And, what is yet worse, let every one but examine his own heart, and he will find
that his private wishes spring and grow up at the expense of some other person.
Upon which consideration this thought came into my head, that nature does not
hereby deviate from her general policy; for the naturalists hold, that the birth,
nourishment, and increase of any one thing is the decay and corruption of
another:</p>

<p class='c014'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. When Meg Merrilies says in her dying moments—‘Nay, nay, lay my head to
the East,’ what was the East to her? Not a reality but an idea of distant time
and the land of her forefathers; the last, the strongest, and the best that occurred
to her in this world. Her gipsy slang and dress were quaint and grotesque; her
attachment to the Kaim of Derncleugh and the wood of Warrock was romantic;
her worship of the East was <i>ideal</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c020' id='f25'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. I have only to add, by way of explanation on this subject, the following
passage from the Characters of Shakspeare’s Plays: ‘There is a certain stage of
society in which people become conscious of their peculiarities and absurdities,
affect to disguise what they are, and set up pretensions to what they are not. This
gives rise to a corresponding style of comedy, the object of which is to detect the
disguises of self-love, and to make reprisals on these preposterous assumptions of
vanity, by marking the contrast between the real and the affected character as
severely as possible, and denying to those, who would impose on us for what they
are not, even the merit which they have. This is the comedy of artificial life, of
wit and satire, such as we see it in Congreve, Wycherley, Vanbrugh, &amp;c. To this
succeeds a state of society from which the same sort of affectation and pretence are
banished by a greater knowledge of the world, or by their successful exposure on
the stage; and which by neutralizing the materials of comic character, both natural
and artificial, leaves no comedy at all—but <i>the sentimental</i>. Such is our modern
comedy. There is a period in the progress of manners anterior to both these, in
which the foibles and follies of individuals are of nature’s planting, not the growth
of art or study; in which they are therefore unconscious of them themselves, or
care not who knows them, if they can but have their whim out; and in which, as
there is no attempt at imposition, the spectators rather receive pleasure from
humouring the inclinations of the persons they laugh at, than wish to give them
pain by exposing their absurdity. This may be called the comedy of nature, and it
is the comedy which we generally find in Shakspeare.’ P. 256.</p>

<p class='c014'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. An old gentleman, riding over Putney-bridge, turned round to his servant, and
said, ‘Do you like eggs, John?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ Here the conversation ended. The
same gentleman riding over the same bridge that day year, again turned round, and
said, ‘How?’ ‘Poached, sir,’ was the answer.—This is the longest pause upon
record, and has something of a dramatic effect, though it could not be transferred
to the stage. Perhaps an actor might go so far, on the principle of indefinite
pauses, as to begin a sentence in one act, and finish it in the next.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f34'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. In the last edition of the works of a modern Poet, there is a Sonnet to the
King, complimenting him on ‘his royal fortitude.’ The story of the Female
Vagrant, which very beautifully and affectingly describes the miseries brought on
the lower classes by war, in bearing which the said ‘royal fortitude’ is so nobly
exercised, is very properly struck out of the collection.</p>

<p class='c014'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. The story of the Heart of Midlothian was, we understand, got up at the Surrey
Theatre last year by Mr. Dibdin, in the most creditable style. A Miss Taylor, we
hear, made an inimitable Jenny Deans, Miss Copeland was surprising as Madge
Wildfire, Mrs. Dibdin as Queen Caroline, was also said to be a complete piece of
royal wax-work, and Dumbydikes was done to the life. Would we had seen
them so done; but we can answer for these things positively on no authority but
our own. If they make as good a thing of Ivanhoe, they will do more than the
author has done.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f43'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. Miss Baillie has much of the power and spirit of dramatic writing, and not

<div class='footnote c020' id='f45'>
<p class='c014'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Generosity and simplicity are not the characteristic virtues of poets. It has

<p class='c014'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. ‘Or mouth with slumbery pout.’ <i>Keats’s Endymion.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>The phrase might be applied to Miss Stephens: though it is a vile phrase, worse
than Hamlet’s ‘beautified’ applied to Ophelia. Indeed it has been remarked that
Mr. Keats resembles Shakspeare in the novelty and eccentricity of his combinations
of style. If so, it is the only thing in which he is like Shakspeare: and yet
Mr. Keats, whose misfortune and crime it is, like Milton, to have been born in
London, is a much better poet than Mr. Wilson, or his Patroclus Mr. Lockart;
nay, further, if Sir Walter Scott (the sly Ulysses of the Auld Reekie school,) had
written many of the passages in Mr. Keats’s poems, they would have been quoted
as the most beautiful in his works. We do not here (on the banks of the Thames)
damn the Scotch novels in the lump, because the writer is a <i>Sawney Scot</i>. But the
sweet Edinburgh wits damn Mr. Keats’s lines in the lump, because he is born in
London. ‘Oh Scotland, judge of England, what a treasure hast thou in one fair
son, and one fair son-in-law, neither of whom (by all accounts) thou lovest passing
well!’</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
